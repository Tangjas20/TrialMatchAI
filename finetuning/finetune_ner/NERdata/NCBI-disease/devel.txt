To O
clarify O

( O

. O

METHODS O
. O

Using O
a O
specific O
radioimmunoassay O
, O
we O
determined O
colchicine O
concentrations O
in O
the O
serum O
and O
breast O
milk O
of O
4 O
patients O
at O
various O
time O
points O
, O
following O
oral O
administration O
of O
the O
drug O
. O

The O
study O
evaluated O
4 O
patients O
with O
FMF B
who O
had O
been O
taking O
colchicine O
on O
a O
long O

basis O
. O

RESULTS O
. O

Colchicine O
was O
found O
to O
be O
excreted O
in O
breast O
milk O
. O

Its O
levels O
ranged O
between O
1 O
. O

9 O
and O
8 O

which O
were O

found O
in O

However O
, O
there O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
considerable O
variation O
in O
colchicine O
milk O
concentration O
among O
the O
different O
patients O
, O
which O
might O
be O
related O

individual O
breast O

composition O
and O
, O
possibly O
, O
to O

nutritional O
or O

CONCLUSION O
. O

The O
extensive O
peripheral O
tissue O
binding O
and O
relatively O
low O
concentration O
of O
colchicine O
in O
breast O
milk O
suggests O
that O
the O

ingested O
by O
the O
infant O
is O
small O
. O

Furthermore O
, O

In O

if O

To O
answer O
these O
questions O

we O
have O
established O
a O

for O
the O

and O
the O

We O
have O
found O
that O
both O
homodimers O
and O
heterodimers O
do O
form O
involving O
each O
of O
the O

that O
both O

However O
, O
these O

they O
probably O
account O

only O
a O

percent O

A O

due O

Due O

these O

generate O
only O
three O
haplotypes O

these O

We O

To O

we O

CONCLUSIONS O
Among O

These O

that O
even O

, O
the O

We O
have O
reported O
the O

In O

we O
have O
observed O
mutations O
involving O

in O
11 O
of O

The O
frequency O

is O
roughly O
the O

in O
the O

Difficulties O

: O
lessons O
to O
be O
drawn O

A O
group O

with O

were O
investigated O
for O

using O

One O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
have O
no O
alternative O

a O
low O

Surprisingly O
, O
investigation O
revealed O
that O
the O
patients O
complement O
was O
normal O
for O
all O
components O
except O
C9 O
, O
which O
was O
functionally O

The O
patient O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
heterozygous O
for O
DNA O
markers O
in O
the O
C6 O
, O
C7 O
and O
C9 O
region O
of O

and O
therefore O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
compound O
heterozygote O
for O
two O
uncharacterized O
C9 B

genes O
. O

Serological O
analysis O
by O

revealed O
that O
he O
has O
trace O
concentrations O
of O
a O
non O

functional O
C9 O
molecule O
. O

Western O

analysis O
was O
not O
sufficiently O
sensitive O
to O
permit O
detection O
of O
this O

. O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
patient O
is O
heterozygous O
for O
a O
complete B
deficiency I
of I
C9 I
and O
for O
a O
gene O
directing O
hyposynthesis O
of O
a O

We O
also O
suggest O
that O

and O
its O
relation O
to O
cyclophosphamide, O
in O

METHODS: O
In O
the O
population O

Swedish O
Inpatient O
Register O
a O
cohort O
of O
1065 O
patients O
with O

with O
the O
Swedish O
Cancer B
Register, O
all O
subjects O
in O
this O
cohort O

were O
identified. O
Nested O
within O
the O
cohort, O
a O

study O
was O
performed O
to O
estimate O
the O
association O
between O
cyclophosphamide O
and O
bladder O
cancer O
using O
odds O
ratios O
(ORs) O
as O
relative O
risk. O
In O
the O
cohort O
the O
cumulative O
risk O
of O

RESULTS: O
The O

The O
risk O

The O
absolute O
risk O
for O
bladder O
cancer O
in O
the O
cohort O
reached O
10% O
16 O
years O
after O
diagnosis O
of O
Wegener's O
granulomatosis, O
and O
a O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
results O
indicate O
a O

CONCLUSION: O
In O
patients O
with O
risk O
factors, O
e.g. O
regular O
consumption O
of O
alcohol, O
liver O
failure O
is O
possible O
when O
therapeutic O
doses O
are O
ingested. O
We O
propose O
that O
the O
paracetamol O
dose O
should O
not O
exceed O
2 O
g/day O
in O
such O
patients O
and O
that O
their O
liver O
function O
should O
be O
monitored O
closely O
while O

by O
L-dopa, O
DL-Threo-dihydroxyphenylserine O

FLA-63, O
a O

did O
not O
have O
any O
effect O
on O
the O
hypotension, B
bradycardia O
or O
reflex-enhancing O
effect O
of O
L-dopa. O
Pimozide O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
actions O
of O
L-dopa O
on O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
but O
completely O
blocked O
the O
enhancement O
of O
reflexes. O
Removal O
of O
the O
carotid O
sinuses O
caused O
an O
elevation O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
and O
abolished O
the O
negative O
chronotropic O
effect O
of O
norepinephrine. O
However, O
L-dopa O
restored O
the O
bradycardia O
caused O
by O
norepinephrine O
in O
addition O
to O
decreasing O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate. O
5-HTP O
(5 O
mg/kg O

decreased O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
and O
decreased O
the O
reflex O
bradycardia O
to O
norepinephrine. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
L-dopa O
enhances O
reflex O
bradycardia O
through O
central O
alpha-receptor O
stimulation. O
Furthermore, O
the O
effects O
are O
mediated O
through O
dopamine O
rather O
than O
norepinephrine O
and O
do O
not O
require O
the O
carotid O
sinus O
baroreceptors. O

MEASUREMENTS O
AND O
MAIN O
RESULTS: O
None O
of O
23 O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
addition O
of O
thalidomide O
to O
docetaxel O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
prostate O

significantly O
increases O
the O

Although O
the O

may O
involve O
an O

Initial O
testing O
in O
a O
time-dependent O

task O
employing O
a O
24-h O

showed O
that O
metrifonate O
improved O
object O

(at O
10 O

30 O
mg/kg, O
p.o.), O
whereas O
Ro4368554 O
was O

In O
conclusion, O
although O
Ro4368554 O

it O
reversed O
a O

INTRODUCTION: O
Cyclophosphamide O
is O
an O
alkylating O
agent O
given O
frequently O
as O
a O
component O
of O
many O
conditioning O
regimens. O
In O
high O
doses, O
its O
nonhematological O
dose-limiting O
toxicity B
is O
cardiomyopathy. B
STUDY O
DESIGN: O
We O
combined O
paclitaxel, O
melphalan O
and O
high-dose O
cyclophosphamide, O
thiotepa, O
and O
carboplatin O
in O
a O
triple O
sequential O
high-dose O
regimen O
for O
patients O
with O
metastatic O
breast B
cancer. I
Analysis O
was O
performed O
on O
61 O
women O
with O
chemotherapy-responsive O
metastatic O
breast O
cancer O
receiving O
96-h O
infusional O
cyclophosphamide O
as O
part O
of O
a O
triple O
sequential O
high-dose O
regimen O
to O
assess O
association O
between O
presence O
of O
peritransplant O
congestive B
heart I

(CHF) O
and B
the O
following O
pretreatment O
characteristics: O
presence O
of O
electrocardiogram O
(EKG) O
abnormalities, O
age, O
hypertension, B
prior O
cardiac O
history, O
smoking, O
diabetes B
mellitus, I
prior O
use O
of O
anthracyclines, O
and O
left-sided O

RESULTS: O
Six O
of O
61 O
women O
(10%) O
developed O
clinically O
reversible O
grade O
3 O
CHF O
following O
infusional O
cyclophosphamide O
with O
a O
median O

of O
31%. O
Incidence O
of O
transient O
cyclophosphamide-related O
cardiac B
toxicity I
(10%) O
is O
comparable O
to O
previous O
recorded O
literature. O
Older O
age O
was O
significantly O
correlated O
with O
the O
CHF O
development; O
with O
median O
ages O
for O
the O
entire O
group O
and O
for O
patients O
developing O
CHF O
of O
45 O
and O
59, O
respectively. O
No O
association O
was O
found O
with O
other O
pretreatment O
characteristics. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
As O
a O
result O
of O
these O
findings, O
oncologists O
should O
carefully O
monitor O
fluid O
balance O
in O
older O
patients. O
Routine O

Nearly O
3.2 O
million O
people O
in O
this O
country O
receive O
aminoglycoside O

annually. O
Gentamicin O
sulfate O
and O
tobramycin O
sulfate O
continue O
to O
demonstrate O
ototoxicity B
and O
nephrotoxicity B
in O
both O
animal O
and O
clinical O
studies. O
In O
this O
study, O
62 O
patients O
with O
confirmed O
initial O
normal O
renal O
function O
and O
treated O
with O
2 O
to O
5 O
mg/kg/day O
of O
gentamicin O
sulfate O
or O
tobramycin O
sulfate O
for O
a O
minimum O
of O
seven O
days O
were O
followed O
up O
prospectively O
for O
the O
development O
of O
aminoglycoside-related O
renal B
failure, I
defined O
as O
at O
least O
a O
one-third O
reduction O
in O
renal O
function. O
In O
these O
62 O
patients, O
no O
other O
causes O
for O
renal O
failure O
could O
be O
identified. O
Five O
of O
33 O
(15%) O
of O
the O
tobramycin-treated O
patients O
and O
16 O
of O
29 O
(55.2%) O
of O
the O
gentamicin-treated O
patients O
had O
renal O
failure. O
Thus, O
gentamicin O
was O
associated O
with O
renal O
failure O
more O
than O
three O
times O
as O
often O
as O
was O
tobramycin. O

A O
Cambodian O
woman O
with O

while O
taking O
a O
dose O
of O

(50 O
mg/day) O
not O

hemolysis. B
Her O
red O

and O
decreased O

The O
pentose O
phosphate O
shunt O
activity O
of O
the O
dapsone-exposed O
AE O
RBCs O
was O
increased O
compared O
to O
normal O
RBCs. O
Although O
the O
AE O
RBCs O
from O
an O
individual O
not O
taking O
dapsone O
had O
increased O
incubated O
Heinz O
body O
formation, O
the O
GSH O

were O
normal. O
The O
pentose O
phosphate O
shunt O
activity O
of O
the O
non-dapsone-exposed O
AE O
RBCs O
was O
decreased O
compared O
to O
normal O
RBCs. O
Thus, O
AE O
RBCs O
appear O
to O
have O
an O
increased O
sensitivity O
to O
oxidant O
stress O
both O
in O

and O
in O

since O
dapsone O
does O
not O
cause O
hemolytic O
anemia O
at O
this O
dose O
in O
hematologically O
normal O
individuals. O
Given O
the O
influx O
of O
Southeast O
Asians O
into O
the O
United O
States, O
oxidant O
medications O
should O
be O
used O
with O
caution, O
especially O
if O

is O
present, O
in O
individuals O
of O

Combination O
chemotherapy O
with O
mitoxantrone, O
high-dose O
5-fluorouracil O
(5-FU) O
and O
leucovorin O
(MFL O

had O
been O
reported O
as O
an O
effective O
and O
well O
tolerated O
regimen. O
From O
October O
1993 O
to O
November O
1995, O
we O
treated O
13 O
patients O
with O
previously O
chemotherapy-treated O
metastatic O
breast O
cancer O
by O
mitoxantrone, O
12 O
mg/m2, O

together O
with O
leucovorin, O
300 O
mg/m2, O
for O
48 O
h O
from O
day O
1 O
to O
2. O
Each O
course O
of O
chemotherapy O
was O
given O
every O
4 O
weeks. O
Most O
of O
these O
patients O
had O
more O
than O
two O
metastatic O
sites, O
with O
lung O
metastasis O
predominant. O
Seven O
patients O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
anthracycline. O
Seven O
patients O
had O
previously O
received O

and O
seven O
had O
received O

Median O
number O
of O
courses O
of O
MFL O
regimen O
given O
was O
six O
and O
the O
median O
cumulative O
dose O
of O
mitoxantrone O
was O
68.35 O
mg/m2. O
One O
patient O
had O
complete O
response, O
seven O
had O
stable O
disease, O
none O
had O
partial O
response O
and O
five O
had O
progressive O
disease. O
The O
overall O
objective O
response O
rate O
was O
7.6%. O
The O
median O
follow-up O
period O
was O
14 O
months. O
Median O
survival O
was O
16 O
months. O
Median O
progression-free O
survival O
was O
5 O
months. O
A O
complete O
responder O
had O
relapse-free O
survival O
up O
to O
17 O
months. O
Major O
toxicities B
were O
cardiotoxicity B
and B
leukopenia. B
Eight O
patients O
were O
dead O
in O
the O
last O
follow-up; O
two O
of O
them O
died O
of O
treatment-related O

The O
MFL O
regimen O
achieves O
little O
palliative O
benefit O
and O
induces O
severe O
toxicity O
at O
a O
fairly O
high O
rate. O
Administration O
of O
this O

patients O
who O
have O
been O
treated O
by O

BACKGROUND: O
Nicotine O
polacrilex O
lozenges O
deliver O
25% O
to O
27% O
more O
nicotine O
compared O
with O
equivalent O
doses O
of O
nicotine O
polacrilex O
gum. O
The O
increased O
nicotine O
exposure O
from O
the O
lozenge O
has O
raised O
questions O
about O
the O
relative O
safety O
of O
the O
lozenge O
and O

OBJECTIVE: O
The O
objective O
of O
this O

METHODS: O
This O
was O
a O

open-label O
study O
in O
adult O
smokers O
with O
heart B

Safety O
assessments O
were O
made O
at O

and O
at O
2, O
4, O

treatment, O
447 O
who O
received O
the O
lozenge O
and O
454 O
who O
received O
the O

(52.7%). O
Patients' O
mean O
age O
was O
53.9 O
years, O
their O

and O
they O
smoked O
a O

were O
equally O
well O
tolerated, O
despite O
increased O
nicotine O
exposure O
from O
the O
lozenge. O
The O
incidence O
of O
adverse O

in O
the O
2 O
groups O
was O
similar O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
of O
product O
use O
(evaluation O
population: O
55.3% O
lozenge, O
54.7% O

as O
well O
as O
during O
the O
entire O
study O
(safety O
population: O
63.8% O

and O
severity O
of O
adverse O
events O
revealed O
no O
clinically O
significant O
differences O
between O
the O
lozenge O
and O

The O
most O
common O
adverse O
events O
were O
nausea B
(17.2% O

Serious O
adverse O
events O
were O
reported O
in O
11 O

13 O
patients O
in O
the O

Fewer O
than O
6% O
of O
patients O
in O

were O
considered O
by O
the O
investigator O
to O
have O
a O
worsening O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
4-mg O

Adriamycin O

A O

the O

determined O
in O
the O

was O
found O
to O
be O
significantly O
decreased, O
while O
the O
phophorylcreatine O

was O
unchanged. O
Such O

BALB/C, O
the O

the O

Amantadine O
treatment O
produced O
a O

locomotor O
activity O
in O
all O
mouse O

studied O
with O
the O

Subsequent O

in O
all O
mouse O
strains O
with O
the O

The O

was O
decreased O
from O

in O
all O

studied, O
except O
for O
the O
ICR O

during O
an O
overnight O

following O
the O
fourth O
amantadine O
treatment. O
Readministration O
of O
amantadine, O
after O
a O

increased O

control O
in O
all O
strains O
with O
exception O
of O
the O
BALB/C O

where O
suppression B
of I

occurred. O
Treatment O
with O
amantadine O
did O
not O
alter O
whole O

but O
decreased O
the O
amounts O
of O
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic O
acid O
in O
the O
BALB/C O
mice O
compared O
to O
saline O
control. O
Conversely, O
brain O
normetanephrine O
concentration O
was O
increased O
from O
saline O
control O
by O
amantadine O
in O
the O
BALB/C O
mice. O
The O
results O
suggest O
a O
strain-dependent O
effect O
of O
amantadine O
on O
motility O
and O
indicate O
a O
differential O
response O
to O
the O
acute O
and O
multiple O
dose O
regimens O
used. O
The O
BALB/C O
mouse O
was O
the O
most O
sensitive O
strain O
and O
could O
serve O
as O
the O
strain O
of O
choice O
for O
evaluating O
the O

effects O
of O
amantadine. O
The O
biochemical O
results O
of O
brain O

of O
BALB/C O
mouse O
strain O
suggest O
a O
probable O
decrease O
of O
catecholamine O
turnover O
rate O
and/or O
metabolism O
by O
monoamine O
oxidase O
and O
a O
resulting O
increase O
in O
O-methylation O
of O

which O
may O
account O
for O
a O
behavioral B

OBJECTIVE: O
This O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
determine O
whether O
patients O
maintained O
on O
a O
regimen O
of O
lithium O
on O
a O
once-per-day O
schedule O
have O
lower O
urine O
volumes O
than O
do O
patients O
receiving O
multiple O
doses O
per O
day. O
METHOD: O
This O
was O
a O
cross-sectional O
study O
of O
85 O
patients O
from O
a O
lithium O
clinic O
who O
received O
different O
dose O
schedules. O
Patients O
were O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
measurement O
of O
lithium O
level, O
creatinine O
clearance, O
urine O
volume, O
and O
maximum O
osmolality. O
RESULTS: O
Multiple O
daily O
doses O
of O
lithium O
were O
associated O
with O
higher O
urine O
volumes. O
The O
dosing O
schedule, O
duration O
of O
lithium O
treatment, O
and O
daily O
dose O
of O
lithium O
did O
not O
affect O
maximum O
osmolality O
or O
creatinine O
clearance. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Urine O
volume O
can O
be O
reduced O
by O
giving O
lithium O
once O
daily O
and/or O
by O
lowering O
the O
total O
daily O
dose. O
Lithium-induced O

Risperidone O
is O
an O
antipsychotic O
drug O
with O
high O
affinity O
at O
dopamine O

receptors. O
Previous O
clinical O
studies O
have O
proposed O
that O
risperidone's O
pharmacologic O
profile O
may O
produce O
improved O
efficacy O
for O
negative O
psychotic B
symptoms I
and O
decreased O
propensity O
for O
extrapyramidal O
side O
effects; O
features O
shared O
by O
so-called O
'atypical' O
neuroleptics. O
To O
determine O
if O
routine O
risperidone O
treatment O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
unique O
degree O
of O
D2 O
receptor O
occupancy O
and O
pattern O
of O
clinical O
effects, O
we O
used O
[123I]IBZM O
SPECT O
to O
determine O
D2 O
occupancy O
in O
subjects O
treated O
with O
routine O
clinical O
doses O
of O
risperidone O
(n O
= O
12) O
or O
haloperidol O
(n O
= O
7). O
Both O
risperidone O
and O
haloperidol O
produced O
D2 O
occupancy O
levels O
between O
approximately O
60 O
and O
90% O
at O
standard O
clinical O
doses. O
There O
was O
no O
significant O
difference O
between O
occupancy O
levels O
obtained O
with O
haloperidol O
or O
risperidone. O
Drug-induced B
parkinsonism I
was O
observed O
in O
subjects O
treated O
with O
risperidone O
(42%) O
and O
haloperidol O
(29%) O
and O
was O
observed O
at O
occupancy O
levels O
above O
60%. O
Based O
on O
these O
observations, O
it O
is O
concluded O
that O
5-HT2 O
blockade O
obtained O
with O
risperidone O
at O
D2 O
occupancy O
rates O
of O
60% O
and O
above O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
protect O
against O
the O
risk O
for O
extrapyramidal O
side O
effects. O

while O
24 O

In O
the O

and O
5-FU O
(1000 O
mg/m2BSA O

a O
continuous O

during O
5 O
days) O
were O
given O
to O
76 O
patients O
before O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
clarify O
the O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
adverse O
cardiac O
effects O
to O
this O
treatment. O
Before O
treatment O
all O
patients O
had O
a O
cardiac O
evaluation O
and O
during O
treatment O
serial O
ECG O
recordings O
were O
performed. O
In O
the O
pre-treatment O
evaluation, O
signs O
of O
cardiovascular B
disease I
were O
found O
in O
33 O
patients O
(43%). O
During O
treatment, O
adverse O
cardiac O
effects O
were O
observed O
in O
14 O
patients O
(18%). O
The O
mean O
age O
of O
these O
patients O
was O
the O
same O
as O
for O
the O
entire O
group, O
64 O
years. O
The O
incidence O
of O
cardiotoxicity B
was O
not O
higher O
in O
patients O
with O
signs O
of O
cardiovascular O
disease O
than O
in O
those O
without O
in O
the O
pre-treatment O
evaluation. O
The O
most O
common O
signs O
of O
cardiotoxicity O
were O
chest B
pain, I
ST-T O
wave O

and O
atrial B

This O
was O
followed O
by O
ventricular B
fibrillation I
in O
one O
patient O
and O
sudden B
death I
in O
another. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
patients O
on O
5-FU O
treatment O
should O
be O
under O
close O
supervision O
and O
that O
the O
treatment O
should O
be O
discontinued O
if O

Adriamycin O
(50 O

then O
weekly O
during O
the O
first O

and O
afterwards O
monthly O
for O
1 O

The O
tolerance O
was O
evaluated O
in O
these O
110 O
patients, O
and O
29 O
patients O
presented O
with O
local O
side-effects. O
In O
24 O
of O
these O
patients O
chemical O
cystitis B
was O
severe O
enough O
for O
them O
to O
drop O
out O
of O
the O
study. O
No O
systemic O
side-effects O
were O
observed. O
Recurrence O
was O
studied O
in O
82 O
evaluable O
patients O
after O
1 O
year O
of O
follow-up O
and O
in O
72 O
patients O
followed O
for O
2-3 O
years O
(mean O
32 O
months). O
Of O
the O
82 O
patients O
studied O
after O
1 O
year, O
23 O
had O
primary O
and O
59 O
recurrent O
disease. O
Of O
the O
82 O
evaluable O
patients, O
50 O
did O
not O
show O
any O
recurrence O
after O
1 O
year O
(61%), O
while O
32 O
presented O
with O
one O
or O
more O
recurrences O
(39%). O
Of O
these O
recurrences, O
27 O
were O
T1 O
tumors O
while O
five O
progressed O
to O
more O
highly O
invasive O
lesions. O
In O
patients O
that O
were O
free O
of O
recurrence O
during O
the O
first O
year, O
80% O
remained O
tumor-free O
during O
the O
2- O

3-year O
follow-up O
period. O
Of O
the O
patients O
developing O
one O
or O
more O
recurrences O
during O
the O
first O
year, O
only O
50% O
presented O
with O
further O
recurrence O
once O
the O
instillations O
were O
stopped. O
The O
beneficial O
effect O
of O
Adriamycin O
appears O
obvious O
and O
might O

INTRODUCTION: O
Many O
substances O
that O
form O
methemoglobin O
(MHb) O
effectively O
counter O
cyanide O
(CN) O
toxicity. B
Although O
MHb O
formers O
are O
generally O
applied O
as O
treatments O
for O
CN O
poisoning, B
it O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
a O
stable, O
long-acting O
MHb O
former O
could O
serve O
as O
a O
CN O
pretreatment. O
Using O
this O
rationale, O
the O
8-aminoquinoline O
WR242511, O
a O
potent O
long-lasting O
MHb O
former O
in O
rodents O
and O
beagle O
dogs, O
was O
studied O
in O
the O
rhesus O
monkey O
for O
advanced O
development O
as O
a O
potential O
CN O
pretreatment. O
METHODS: O
In O
this O
study, O
WR242511 O
was O
administered O
intravenously O
(IV) O
in O
2 O
female O
and O
4 O
male O
rhesus O
monkeys O
in O
doses O
of O
3.5 O
and/or O
7.0 O
mg/kg; O
a O
single O
male O
also O
received O
WR242511 O
orally O
(PO) O
at O
7.0 O
mg/kg. O
Health O
status O
and O
MHb O
levels O
were O
monitored O
following O
exposure. O
RESULTS: O
The O
selected O
doses O
of O
WR242511, O
which O
produced O
significant O
methemoglobinemia B
in O
beagle O
dogs O
in O
earlier O
studies O
conducted O
elsewhere, O
produced O
very O
little O
MHb O
(mean O
< O
2.0%) O
in O
the O
rhesus O
monkey. O
Furthermore, O
transient O
hemoglobinuria B
was O
noted O
approximately O
60 O
minutes O
postinjection O
of O
WR242511 O
(3.5 O
or O
7.0 O
mg/kg), O
and O
2 O
lethalities O
occurred O
(one O
IV O
and O
one O
PO) O
following O
the O
7.0 O
mg/kg O
dose. O
Myoglobinuria B
was O
also O
observed O
following O
the O
7.0 O
mg/kg O
dose. O
Histopathology O
analyses O
in O
the O
2 O
animals O
that O
died O
revealed O
liver B
and I
kidney B
toxicity, I
with O
greater O
severity O
in O
the O
orally-treated O
animal. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
data O
demonstrate O
direct O
and/or O
indirect O
drug-induced O
toxicity. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
WR242511 O
should O
not O
be O
pursued O
as O
a O
pretreatment O
for O
CN O
poisoning O
unless O
the O
anti-CN O
characteristics O
of O
this O
compound O
can O
be O
successfully O
dissociated O
from O
those O
producing O
undesirable O
toxicity. O

BACKGROUND: O
An O
association O
between O
the O
use O
of O
oral O
contraceptives O
and O
the O
risk O
of O
myocardial B
infarction I
has O
been O
found O
in O
some, O
but O
not O
all, O
studies. O
We O
investigated O
this O
association, O
according O
to O
the O
type O
of O
progestagen O
included O
in O
third-generation O
(i.e., O
desogestrel O
or O
gestodene) O
and O
second-generation O
(i.e., O
levonorgestrel) O
oral O
contraceptives, O
the O
dose O
of O
estrogen, O
and O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
prothrombotic O
mutations O
METHODS: O
In O
a O
nationwide, O
population-based, O
case-control O
study, O
we O
identified O
and O
enrolled O
248 O

RESULTS: O
The O

among O
women O
who O
used O
any O
type O
of O
combined O
oral O

was O
2.0 O
(95 O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
risk O
of O
myocardial O
infarction O
was O
increased O
among O
women O
who O
used O
second-generation O
oral O
contraceptives. O
The O
results O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
use O
of O
third-generation O
oral O
contraceptives O
were O
inconclusive O
but O
suggested O
that O
the O
risk O
was O
lower O
than O
the O
risk O
associated O
with O
second-generation O
oral O
contraceptives. O
The O
risk O
of O
myocardial O
infarction O
was O
similar O
among O
women O
who O
used O
oral O
contraceptives O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
had O

as O
compared O
with O

in O
the O

This O

indicates O
that O
with O

the O

and O
the O

be O
completely O

This O
demonstrates O
the O
participation O

antagonizing O
the O

Cluster B
headache I
is O
characterized O
by O
typical O
autonomic O
dysfunctions O
including O
facial O
and O
intracranial B
vascular I
disturbances. I
Both O
the O
trigeminal O
and O
the O
cranial O
parasympathetic O
systems O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
mediating O
these O
dysfunctions. O
An O
experimental O
model O
was O
developed O
in O
the O
rat O
to O
measure O
changes O
in O
lacrimation O
and O
intracranial O
blood O
flow O
following O
noxious O
chemical O
stimulation O
of O
facial O
mucosa. O
Blood O
flow O
was O
monitored O
in O
arteries O
of O
the O
exposed O
cranial O
dura O
mater O
and O
the O
parietal O
cortex O
using O
laser O
Doppler O
flowmetry. O
Capsaicin O
(0.01-1 O
mm) O
applied O
to O
oral O
or O
nasal O
mucosa O
induced O
increases B
in I
dural I
and I
cortical I
blood I
flow I
and O
provoked O
lacrimation. O
These O
responses O
were O
blocked O
by O
systemic O
pre-administration O
of O
hexamethonium O
chloride O
(20 O
mg/kg). O
The O
evoked O
increases B
in I
dural I
blood I
flow I
were O
also O
abolished O
by O
topical O
pre-administration O
of O
atropine O
(1 O
mm) O
and O
[Lys1, O
Pro2,5, O
Arg3,4, O
Tyr6]-VIP O
(0.1 O
mm), O
a O
vasoactive O
intestinal O
polypeptide O
(VIP) O
antagonist, O
onto O
the O
exposed O
dura O
mater. O
We O
conclude O
that O
noxious O
stimulation O
of O
facial O
mucosa O
increases O
intracranial O
blood O
flow O
and O
lacrimation O
via O
a O
trigemino-parasympathetic O
reflex. O
The O
blood O
flow O
responses O
seem O
to O
be O
mediated O
by O
the O
release O
of O
acetylcholine O
and O
VIP O
within O
the O
meninges. O
Similar O
mechanisms O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O

The O
development O

produced O
by O

studied O
in O
rats. O
Saline-pretreated O
controls O
given O
a O
test O
dose O
of O
morphine O
(20 O
mg/kg O
i.p.) O
showed O
a O
pronounced O
rigidity O
recorded O
as O
tonic O
activity O
in O
the O
electromyogram. O
Rats O
treated O
for O
11 O
days O
with O
morphine O
and O
withdrawn O
for O
36-40 O
h O
showed O
differences O
in O
the O
development O
of O
tolerance: O
about O
half O
of O
the O
animals O
showed O
a O
rigidity O
after O
the O
test O
dose O
of O
morphine O
that O
was O
not O
significantly O
less O
than O
in O
the O
controls O
and O
were O
akinetic B
(A O
group). O
The O
other O
rats O
showed O
a O
strong O
decrease O
in O
the O
rigidity O
and O
the O
occurrence O
of O
stereotyped O
(S) O
licking O
and/or O
gnawing O
in O
presence O
of O
akinetic O
or O
hyperkinetic B
(K) O
behaviour O
(AS/KS O
group), O
suggesting O
signs O
of O
dopaminergic O
activation. O
The O
rigidity O
was O
considerably O
decreased O
in O
both O
groups O
after O
20 O
days' O
treatment. O
In O
a O
further O
series O
of O
experiments, O
haloperidol O
(0.2 O
mg/kg O
i.p.) O
was O
used O
in O
order O
to O
block O
the O
dopaminergic O
activation O
and O
to O
estimate O
the O
real O
degree O
of O
the O
tolerance O
to O
the O
rigidity O
without O
any O
dopaminergic O
interference. O
Haloperidol O
enhanced O
the O
rigidity O
in O
the O
A O
group. O
However, O
the O
level O
in O
the O
AS/KS O
group O
remained O
considerably O
lower O
than O
in O
the O
A O
group. O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
rigidity, O
which O
is O
assumed O
to O
be O
due O
to O
an O
action O
of O
morphine O
in O
the O
striatum, O
can O
be O
antagonized O
by O
another O
process O
leading O
to O
dopaminergic O
activation O
in O
the O
striatum. O
Nevertheless, O
there O
occurs O
some O
real O
tolerance O
to O
this O
effect. O
The O
rapid O
alternations O
of O
rigidity O
and O
the O
signs O
of O
dopaminergic O
activation O
observed O
in O
the O
animals O
of O
the O
AS/KS O
group O
might O
be O
due O
to O
rapid O
shifts O
in O
the O
predominance O
of O
various O
DA-innervated O
structures. O

is O
to O
describe O
two O
cases O
of O
a O
disulfiram-like O
syndrome O
following O
occupational O
exposure O
to O
hydrogen O
cyanamide. O
The O
first O
case O
involved O
a O
59-year-old O
man O
who O
used O
Dormex, O
which O
contains O
hydrogen O
cyanamide, O
without O
protection O
after O
consuming O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
alcohol O
during O
a O
meal. O
In O
less O
than O
1 O
hour O
after O
the O
ingestion O
of O
alcohol, O
he O
developed O
malaise O
with O
flushing B
of I
the I
face, I
tachycardia, B
and O
dyspnea. B
Manifestations O
regressed O
spontaneously O
under O
surveillance O
in O
the O
hospital. O
The O
second O
case O
occurred O
in O
a O
55-year-old O
farmer O
following O
cutaneous O
contact O
with O
Dormex. O
Five O
hours O
after O
exposure, O
he O
developed O
disulfiram-like O
syndrome O
with O
flushing, O
tachycardia, O
and O
arterial B
hypotension I
after O
consuming O
three O
glasses O
of O
wine. O
The O
patient O
recovered O
spontaneously O
in O
3 O
hours O
under O
surveillance O
in O
the O
hospital. O
These O
cases O
confirm O
the O
necessity O
of O
avoiding O
alcohol O
consumption O
as O
recommended O
in O
the O
instructions O
for O
use O
of O
Dormex O
and O
of O
preventing O
cutaneous O
contact O
during O
use. O

Glomerular O

To O

the O
utility O

a O
marker O
of O
glomerular B
injury, I
the O
amount O

were O
examined O
by O

in O
a O

at O
0, O
5, O
7, O
11, O
21, O
45, O
80 O

126 O
days O
after O

so O
as O
to O
include O
both O
the O
acute O
phase O
of O
proteinuria B
associated O
with O
foot O

effacement O
(days O
5-11) O
and O
the O
chronic O
phase O
of O
proteinuria O
associated O
with O
glomerulosclerosis B
(days O
45-126). O
At O
day O
5, O
GLEPP1 O
protein O
and O
mRNA O
were O
reduced O
from O
the O
normal O
range O
(265.2 O
+/- O
79.6 O
x O
10(6) O
moles/glomerulus O
and O
100%) O
to O
15% O
of O
normal O
(41.8 O
+/- O
4.8 O
x O
10(6) O
moles/glomerulus, O
p O
< O
0.005). O
This O
occurred O
in O
association O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
urinary O
protein O
content O
from O
1.8 O
+/- O
1 O
to O
99.0 O
+/- O
61 O
mg/day O
(p O
< O
0.001). O
In O
contrast, O
podocalyxin O
did O
not O
change O
significantly O
at O
this O
time. O
By O
day O
11, O
GLEPP1 O
protein O
and O
mRNA O
had O
begun O
to O
return O
towards O
baseline. O
By O
day O
45-126, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
glomerular O
scarring O
was O
present, O
GLEPP1 O
was O
absent O
from O
glomerulosclerotic O
areas O
although O
the O
total O
glomerular O
content O
of O
GLEPP1 O
was O
not O
different O
from O
normal. O
We O
conclude O
that O
GLEPP1 O
expression, O
unlike O
podocalyxin, O
reflects O
podocyte O
injury O
induced O
by O
PAN. O
GLEPP1 O
expression O
may O
be O
a O
useful O
marker O
of O
podocyte O
injury. O

a O
report O
of O
cauda B
equina I
syndrome I
possibly O
caused O
by O
epidural O
injection O
of O
triamcinolone O
and O

CLINICAL O
FEATURES: O
A O
50-year-old O
woman O
with O
low B
back I
and I
right I
leg I
pain B
was O
scheduled O
for O
epidural O
steroid O
injection. O
INTERVENTION O
AND O
OUTCOME: O
An O
18-gauge O
Touhy O
needle O
was O
inserted O
until O
loss O
of O
resistance O
occurred O
at O
the O
L4-5 O
level. O
Spread O
of O
the O
contrast O
medium O
within O
the O
epidural O
space O
was O
determined O
by O
radiographic O
imaging. O
After O
verifying O
the O
epidural O
space, O
bupivacaine O
and O
triamcinolone O
diacetate O
were O
injected. O
After O
the O
injection, O
there O
was O
a O
reduction O
in O
radicular O
symptoms. O
Three O
hours O
later, O
she O
complained O
of O
perineal O
numbness B
and O
lower B
extremity I
weakness. I
The O
neurologic O
evaluation O
revealed O
loss B
of I
sensation I
in O
the O
saddle O
area O
and O
medial O
aspect O
of O
her O
right O
leg. O
There O
was O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
perception O
of O
pinprick O
test. O
Deep-tendon O
reflexes O
were O
decreased O
especially O
in O
the O
right O
leg. O
She O
was O
unable O
to O
urinate. O
The O
patient's O
symptoms O
improved O
slightly O
over O
the O
next O
few O
hours. O
She O
had O
a O
gradual O
return O
of O
motor O
function O
and O
ability O
of O
feeling O
Foley O
catheter. O
All O
of O
the O
symptoms O
were O
completely O
resolved O
over O
the O
next O
8 O
hours. O
CONCLUSION: O
Complications O
associated O
with O
epidural O
steroid O
injections O
are O
rare. O
Clinical O
examination O
and O
continued O
vigilance O
for O
neurologic B
deterioration I
after O
epidural O
steroid O
injections O
is O
important. O

Dipyridamole-thallium-201 O
imaging O
is O
often O
performed O
in O
patients O
unable O
to O
exercise O
because O
of O
peripheral B
vascular I
disease. I
Many O
of O
these O
patients O
are O
taking O
pentoxifylline O
(Trental), O
a O
methylxanthine O
derivative O
which O
may O
improve O
intermittent B
claudication. I
Whether O
pentoxifylline O
inhibits O
dipyridamole-induced O
coronary O
hyperemia B
like O
other O
methylxanthines O
such O
as O
theophylline O
and O
should O
be O
stopped O
prior O
to O
dipyridamole-thallium-201 O
imaging O
is O
unknown. O
Therefore, O
we O
studied O
the O
hyperemic O
response O
to O
dipyridamole O
in O
seven O
open-chest O
anesthetized O
dogs O
after O
pretreatment O
with O
either O
pentoxifylline O
(0, O
7.5, O
or O
15 O
mg/kg O
i.v.) O
or O
theophylline O
(3 O
mg/kg O
i.v.). O
Baseline O
circumflex O
coronary O
blood O
flows O
did O
not O
differ O
significantly O
among O
treatment O
groups. O
Dipyridamole O
significantly O
increased O
coronary O
blood O
flow O
before O
and O
after O
7.5 O
or O
15 O
mm/kg O
i.v. O
pentoxifylline O
(p O
less O
than O
0.002). O
Neither O
dose O
of O
pentoxifylline O
significantly O
decreased O
the O
dipyridamole-induced O
hyperemia, O
while O
peak O
coronary O
blood O
flow O
was O
significantly O
lower O
after O
theophylline O
(p O
less O
than O
0.01). O
We O
conclude O
that O
pentoxyifylline O
does O
not O
inhibit O
dipyridamole-induced O
coronary O
hyperemia O
even O
at O
high O
doses. O

OBJECTIVES: O
To O
study O
the O
long-term O
effects O
of O
androgen O

in O
postmenopausal O
women. O
METHODS: O
In O
a O
population-based O
study O
in O
513 O
naturally O
postmenopausal O
women O
aged O
54-67 O
years, O
we O
studied O
the O
association O
between O
self-reported O
intramuscularly O
administered O
high-dose O
estrogen-testosterone O
therapy O
(estradiol- O
and O
testosterone O
esters) O
and O
aortic O
atherosclerosis. O
Aortic O
atherosclerosis O
was O
diagnosed O
by O
radiographic O
detection O
of O
calcified O
deposits O
in O
the O
abdominal O
aorta, O
which O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
reflect O
intima O
atherosclerosis. O
Hormone O
therapy O
users O
were O
compared O
with O
never O
users. O
RESULTS: O
Intramuscular O
hormone O
therapy O
use O
for O
1 O
year O
or O
longer O
was O
reported O
by O
25 O
women. O
In O
almost O
half O
of O
these O
women O
severe O
atherosclerosis O
of O
the O
aorta O
was O
present O
(n=11), O
while O
in O
women O
without O
hormone O
use O
severe O
atherosclerosis O
of O
the O
aorta O
was O
present O
in O
less O
than O
20% O
(OR O
3.1; O
95% O
CI, O
1.1-8.5, O
adjusted O
for O
age, O
years O
since O
menopause, O

The O
association O
remained O
after O
additional O
adjustment O
for O
diabetes, B

or O
alcohol O
use. O
No O
association O
was O
found O
for O
hormone O
use O
less O
than O
1 O
year. O
CONCLUSION: O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
high-dose O
testosterone O
therapy O
may O
adversely O
affect O
atherosclerosis O
in O
postmenopausal O
women O
and O
indicate O
that O
androgen O
replacement O
in O
these O
women O
may O
not O
be O
harmless. O

were O
determined, O
as O

Histopathologic O
evaluation O

in O
the O
plasma O
creatinine O
concentration O
and O
a O
significant O
(p O

0.0001) O
decrease O
in O

was O
noted O

After O
the O

of O
NG, O
5-FU O

CY O
neither O
a O
statistically O
significant O

nor O
an O
increase O
in O

regimen, O
a O
statistically O
significant O
decrease O
(p O

0.0343) O
in O
creatinine O

was O
found, O
but O
creatinine O

did O
not O
increase O
significantly O
compared O
to O
controls. O
CY O
caused O
hemorrhagic B

in O
40% O
of O

but O
it O
did O
not O
cause O
this O
complication O
when O
combined O
with O
5-FU O

were O
found O
in O

after O
5-FU O
and O
joint O
administration O
of O
MTX O

Our O
studies O
indicate O
that O

RESULTS: O
All O
the O
patients O
were O
examined O
for O
toxicity; O
34 O
were O
examinable O
for O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
combination O
of O
paclitaxel, O
cisplatin, O
and O
gemcitabine O
is O
well O
tolerated O
and O
shows O
high O

regimens. O

Grape O
seed O
extract, O
primarily O
a O
mixture O
of O
proanthocyanidins, O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
modulate O
a O
wide-range O
of O
biological, O
pharmacological O
and O
toxicological O
effects O
which O
are O
mainly O
cytoprotective. O
This O
study O
assessed O
the O
ability O
of O
IH636 O
grape O
seed O
proanthocyanidin O
extract O
(GSPE) O
to O
prevent O
acetaminophen O
(AAP)-induced O
nephrotoxicity, B
amiodarone O
(AMI)-induced O
lung B
toxicity, I
and O
doxorubicin O
(DOX)-induced O
cardiotoxicity B
in O
mice. O
Experimental O
design O
consisted O
of O
four O
groups: O
control O
(vehicle O
alone), O
GSPE O
alone, O
drug O
alone O
and O
GSPE+drug. O
For O
the O
cytoprotection O
study, O
animals O
were O
orally O
gavaged O
100 O
mg/Kg O
GSPE O
for O
7-10 O
days O
followed O
by O
i.p. O
injections O
of O
organ O
specific O
three O
drugs O
(AAP: O
500 O
mg/Kg O
for O
24 O
h; O
AMI: O
50 O
mg/Kg/day O
for O
four O
days; O
DOX: O
20 O
mg/Kg O
for O
48 O
h). O
Parameters O
of O
study O
included O
analysis O
of O
serum O
chemistry O
(ALT, O
BUN O
and O
CPK), O
and O
orderly O
fragmentation O
of O
genomic O
DNA O
(both O
endonuclease-dependent O
and O
independent) O
in O
addition O
to O
microscopic O
evaluation O
of O
damage O
and/or O
protection O
in O
corresponding O
PAS O
stained O
tissues. O
Results O
indicate O
that O
GSPE O
preexposure O
prior O
to O
AAP, O
AMI O
and O
DOX, O
provided O
near O
complete O
protection O
in O
terms O
of O
serum O
chemistry O
changes O
(ALT, O
BUN O
and O
CPK), O
and O
significantly O
reduced O
DNA O
fragmentation. O
Histopathological O
examination O
of O
kidney, O
heart O
and O
lung O
sections O
revealed O
moderate O
to O
massive O
tissue B
damage I
with O
a O
variety O
of O
morphological O
aberrations O
by O
all O
the O
three O
drugs O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
GSPE O
preexposure O
than O
in O
its O
presence. O
GSPE+drug O
exposed O
tissues O
exhibited O
minor O
residual O
damage O
or O
near O
total O
recovery. O
Additionally, O
histopathological O
alterations O
mirrored O
both O
serum O
chemistry O
changes O
and O
the O
pattern O
of O
DNA O
fragmentation. O
Interestingly, O
all O
the O
drugs, O
such O
as, O
AAP, O
AMI O
and O
DOX O
induced O
apoptotic O
death O
in O
addition O
to O
necrosis B
in O
the O
respective O
organs O
which O
was O
very O
effectively O
blocked O
by O
GSPE. O
Since O
AAP, O
AMI O
and O
DOX O
undergo O
biotransformation O
and O
are O
known O
to O
produce O
damaging O
radicals O
in O
vivo, O
the O
protection O
by O
GSPE O
may O
be O
linked O
to O
both O
inhibition O
of O
metabolism O
and/or O
detoxification O
of O
cytotoxic O
radicals. O
In O
addition, O
its' O
presumed O
contribution O
to O
DNA O
repair O
may O
be O
another O
important O
attribute, O
which O
played O
a O
role O
in O
the O
chemoprevention O
process. O
Additionally, O
this O
may O
have O
been O
the O
first O
report O
on O
AMI-induced O
apoptotic O
death O
in O
the O
lung O
tissue. O
Taken O
together, O
these O
events O
undoubtedly O
establish O
GSPE's O
abundant O
bioavailability, O
and O
the O
power O
to O
defend O
multiple O
target O
organs O
from O
toxic O
assaults O
induced O
by O
structurally O
diverse O
and O
functionally O
different O
entities O
in O
vivo. O

Blood O
pressure O
(BP) O
is O
more O
salt O
sensitive O
in O
men O
than O
in O
premenopausal O
women. O
In O
Dahl O
salt-sensitive O
rats O
(DS), O
high-salt O
(HS) O
diet O
increases O
BP O
more O
in O
males O
than O
females. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
systemic O
renin-angiotensin O
system, O
which O
is O
suppressed O
in O
response O
to O
HS O
in O
male O
DS, O
intrarenal O
angiotensinogen O
expression O
is O
increased, O
and O
intrarenal O
levels O
of O
ANG O
II O
are O
not O
suppressed. O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
hypothesis O
was O
tested O
that O
there O
is O
a O
sexual O
dimorphism O
in O
HS-induced O
upregulation O
of O
intrarenal O
angiotensinogen O
mediated O
by O
testosterone O
that O
also O
causes O
increases O
in O
BP O
and O
renal B
injury. I
On O
a O
low-salt O
(LS) O
diet, O
male O
DS O
had O
higher O
levels O
of O
intrarenal O
angiotensinogen O
mRNA O
than O
females. O
HS O
diet O
for O
4 O
wk O
increased O
renal O
cortical O
angiotensinogen O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
only O
in O
male O
DS, O
which O
was O
prevented O
by O
castration. O
Ovariectomy O
of O
female O
DS O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
intrarenal O
angiotensinogen O
expression O
on O
either O
diet. O
Radiotelemetric O
BP O
was O
similar O
between O
males O
and O
castrated O
rats O
on O
LS O
diet. O
HS O
diet O
for O
4 O
wk O
caused O
a O
progressive O
increase O
in O
BP, O
protein O
and O
albumin O
excretion, O
and O
glomerular B
sclerosis I
in O
male O
DS O
rats, O
which O
were O
attenuated O
by O
castration. O
Testosterone O
replacement O
in O
castrated O
DS O
rats O
increased O
BP, O
renal O
injury, O
and O
upregulation O
of O
renal O
angiotensinogen O
associated O
with O
HS O
diet. O
Testosterone O
contributes O
to O
the O
development O
of O
hypertension B
and O
renal O
injury O
in O
male O
DS O
rats O
on O
HS O
diet O
possibly O
through O

Pain B
memory O
is O
thought O
to O
affect O
future O
pain B
sensitivity O
and O
thus O
contribute O
to O
clinical O
pain O
conditions. O
Systematic O
investigations O
of O
the O
human O
capacity O
to O
remember O
sensory O
features O
of O
experimental O
pain O
are O
sparse. O
In O
order O
to O
address O
long-term O
pain O
memory, O
nine O
healthy O
male O
volunteers O
received O
intradermal O
injections O
of O
three O
doses O
of O
capsaicin O
(0.05, O
1 O
and O
20 O
microg, O
separated O
by O
15 O
min O
breaks), O
each O
given O
three O
times O
in O
a O
balanced O
design O
across O
three O
sessions O
at O
one O
week O
intervals. O
Pain O
rating O
was O
performed O
using O
a O
computerized O
visual O
analogue O
scale O
(0-100) O
digitized O
at O
1/s, O
either O
immediately O
online O
or O
one O
hour O
or O
one O
day O
after O
injection. O
Subjects O
also O
recalled O
their O
pains B
one O
week O
later. O
Capsaicin O
injection O
reliably O
induced O
a O
dose-dependent O
flare O
(p<0.001) O
without O
any O
difference O
within O
or O
across O
sessions. O
The O
strong O
burning O
pain O
decayed O
exponentially O
within O
a O
few O
minutes. O
Subjects O
were O
able O
to O
reliably O
discriminate O
pain O
magnitude O
and O
duration O
across O
capsaicin O
doses O
(both O
p<0.001), O
regardless O
of O
whether O
first-time O
ratings O
were O
requested O
immediately, O
after O
one O
hour O
or O
after O
one O
day. O
Pain O
recall O
after O
one O
week O
was O
similarly O
precise O
(magnitude: O
p<0.01, O
duration: O
p<0.05). O
Correlation O
with O
rating O
recall O
after O
one O
week O
was O
best O
when O
first-time O
ratings O
were O
requested O
as O
late O
as O
one O
day O
after O
injection O
(R(2)=0.79) O
indicating O
that O
both O
rating O
retrievals O
utilized O
similar O
memory O
traces. O
These O
results O
indicate O
a O
reliable O
memory O
for O
magnitude O
and O
duration O
of O
experimentally O
induced O
pain. O
The O
data O
further O
suggest O
that O
the O
consolidation O
of O
this O
memory O
is O
an O
important O
interim O
stage, O
and O
may O
take O
up O
to O
one O
day. O

A O
total O
of O
sixty O
patients O
were O
trated O
with O
bromperidol O
first O
in O

(20 O
patients), O
then O
on O
a O
double O
blind O
basis O
(40 O
patients) O
with O
haloperidol O
as O
the O
reference O
substance. O
The O
open O
study O
lasted O
for O
four O
weeks; O
the O
drug O
was O
administrated O
in O
the O
form O
of O
1 O
mg O
tablets. O
The O
daily O

(initial O
dose: O
1 O
mg; O
mean O

at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
trial: O
4.47 O
mg) O
was O
always O
administered O
in O
one O
single O
dose. O
Nineteen O
patients O
finished O
the O
trial, O
and O
in O
18 O
cases O
the O
therapeutic O
result O
was O
considered O
very O
good O
to O
good. O
These O
results O
were O
confirmed O
by O
statistical O
analysis. O
Nine O
patients O
exhibited O
mild O
to O
moderate O
extrapyramidal B
concomitant I
symptoms; I
no O
other O

were O
observed. O
The O
results O
of O
detailed O
laboratory O
tests O
and O
evaluations O
of O
various O
quantitative O
and O
qualitative O
tolerability O
parameters O
were O
not O
indicative O
of O
toxic O

In O
the O
double O

study O
with O
haloperidol, O
both O
substances O
were O
found O
to O
be O
highly O
effective O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
psychotic B

belonging I
predominantly I
to I
the I

Certain O
clues, O
including O
the O
onset O
of O

seem O
to O
be O
indicative O
of O
the O
superiority O
of O
bromperidol. O
No O
differences O
were O
observed O
with O
respect O

We O
tested O
the O

Fucoidan-treated O
rats O
exhibited O
evidence O

and O
tended O
to O
have O
less O

They O
showed O
significantly O
more O

Calcineurin-inhibitor O
therapy O
can O

in O
heart O
transplantation O
patients. O
The O
novel O
immunosuppressive O
(IS) O
drug O
sirolmus O
(Srl) O
lacks O
nephrotoxic B
effects; O
however, O
proteinuria B
associated O
with O
Srl O
has O
been O
reported O
following O
renal O
transplantation. O
In O
cardiac O
transplantation, O
the O
incidence O
of O
proteinuria O
associated O
with O
Srl O
is O
unknown. O
In O
this O
study, O
long-term O
cardiac O
transplant O
patients O
were O
switched O
from O
cyclosporine O
to O
Srl-based O
IS. O
Concomitant O
IS O
consisted O
of O
mycophenolate O
mofetil O
+/- O
steroids. O
Proteinuria O
increased O
significantly O
from O
a O
median O
of O
0.13 O
g/day O
(range O
0-5.7) O
preswitch O
to O
0.23 O
g/day O
(0-9.88) O
at O
24 O
months O
postswitch O
(p O
= O
0.0024). O
Before O
the O
switch, O
11.5% O
of O
patients O
had O
high-grade O
proteinuria O
(>1.0 O
g/day); O
this O
increased O
to O
22.9% O
postswitch O
(p O
= O
0.006). O
ACE O
inhibitor O
and O
angiotensin-releasing O
blocker O
(ARB) O
therapy O
reduced O
proteinuria O
development. O
Patients O
without O
proteinuria O
had O
increased O
renal O
function O
(median O
42.5 O
vs. O
64.1, O
p O
= O
0.25), O
whereas O
patients O
who O
developed O
high-grade O
proteinuria O
showed O
decreased O
renal O
function O
at O
the O
end O
of O
follow-up O
(median O
39.6 O
vs. O
29.2, O
p O
= O
0.125). O
Thus, O
proteinuria O
may O
develop O
in O
cardiac O
transplant O
patients O
after O
switch O
to O
Srl, O
which O
may O
have O
an O
adverse O
effect O
on O
renal O
function O
in O
these O
patients. O
Srl O
should O
be O
used O
with O
ACEi/ARB O
therapy O
and O
patients O
monitored O
for O
proteinuria O
and O
increased O
renal O

blood O
pressure O
after O
nitroglycerin O
were O
similar O
in O
the O
normal O
and O
diabetic O
subjects O
without O
autonomic O
neuropathy, O
whereas O
a O
lesser O
increase O
in O
heart O
rate O
and O
a O
greater O
decrease O
in O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
occurred O
in O
the O
diabetic O
subjects O
with O
autonomic O
neuropathy. O
It O
is O
therefore O
suggested O
that O
caution O
should O
be O
exercised O
when O
prescribing O
vasodilator O
drugs O
in O
diabetic O
patients, O
particularly O
those O
with O
autonomic O

This O
study O
describes O
neuropsychiatric O
side O
effects O
in O
patients O
after O
treatment O
with O
mefloquine. O
Reactions O
consisted O
mainly O
of O
seizures, B
acute O
psychoses, B
anxiety B
neurosis, I
and O
major O
disturbances B
of I
sleep-wake I
rhythm. I
Side O
effects O
occurred O
after O
both O
therapeutic O
and O
prophylactic O
intake O
and O
were O
graded O
from O
moderate O
to O
severe. O
In O
a O
risk O
analysis O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
side O
effects O
in O
Germany, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
one O
of O
8,000 O
mefloquine O
users O
suffers O
from O
such O
reactions. O
The O
incidence O
calculation O
revealed O
that O
one O
of O
215 O
therapeutic O
users O
had O
reactions, O
compared O
with O
one O
of O
13,000 O
in O
the O
prophylaxis O
group, O
making O
the O
risk O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
reactions O
after O
mefloquine O
treatment O
60 O
times O
higher O
than O
after O
prophylaxis. O
Therefore, O
certain O
limitations O
for O
malaria B
prophylaxis O
and O
treatment O
with O
mefloquine O
are O
recommended. O
