Although O

not O

their O

When O

the O

increase O
in O

Moreover O
, O
in O

cells O

BRCA1 O

are O

" O
BRCA1 O

Here O

that O

However O
, O

during O

Nevertheless O

exclusively O
in O
the O

Therefore O

It O

We O
found O
that O
the O

OBJECTIVE: O
The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
risk O
of O
lifetime O
and O
current O
methamphetamine-induced O
psychosis B
in O
patients O
with O
methamphetamine O
dependence. O
The O
association O
between O

was O
also O
studied. O
METHODS: O
This O
was O
a O
cross-sectional O
study O
conducted O
concurrently O
at O
a O
teaching O
hospital O
and O
a O
drug O
rehabilitation O
center O
in O
Malaysia. O
Patients O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
of O

based O
on O
DSM-IV O
were O
interviewed O
using O
the O
Mini O
International O
Neuropsychiatric O
Interview O
(M.I.N.I.) O
for O
methamphetamine-induced O
psychosis O
and O

or O
medical O
records. O
RESULTS: O
Of O
292 O
subjects, O
47.9% O
of O
the O
subjects O
had O
a O
past O
history O
of O
psychotic B
symptoms I
and O
13.0% O
of O
the O
patients O
were O
having O
current O
psychotic O
symptoms. O
Co-morbid O

disorder I
(OR=12.619, O
95 O
CI=6.702-23.759) O
and O
heavy O

(OR=3.299, O
95 O
CI=1.375-7.914) O
were O
the O
only O
factors O

with O
current O
psychosis. O
CONCLUSION: O
There O
was O
a O
high O
risk O
of O
psychosis O
in O
patients O
with O
methamphetamine O
dependence. O
It O
was O
associated O
with O
co-morbid O
affective B
disorder, I
antisocial O
personality, O
and O
heavy O
methamphetamine O
use. O
It O
is O
recommended O
that O
all O
cases O
of O

should O
be O
screened O
for O
psychotic O
symptoms. O

patients. O

The O

(M1) O
in O
patients O
with O
Parkinson's B
disease I
(PD) O
and B
levodopa-induced O
dyskinesias B
(LIDs) O
is B
severely O
impaired. O
We O
recently O
reported O
in O
young O
healthy O
subjects O
that O
inhibitory O
cerebellar O
stimulation O
enhanced O
the O
sensorimotor O
plasticity O
of O
M1 O
that O
was O
induced O
by O
paired O
associative O
stimulation O
(PAS). O
This O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
deficient O
sensorimotor O
M1 O
plasticity O
in O
16 O
patients O
with O
LIDs O
could O
be O
reinstated O
by O
a O
single O
session O
of O
real O
inhibitory O
cerebellar O
stimulation O
but O
not O
sham O
stimulation. O
This O
was O
evident O
only O
when O
a O
sensory O
component O
was O
involved O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
plasticity, O
indicating O
that O
cerebellar O
sensory O
processing O
function O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
resurgence O
of O
M1 O
plasticity. O
The O
benefit O
of O
inhibitory O
cerebellar O
stimulation O
on O
LIDs O
is O
known. O
To O
explore O
whether O
this O
benefit O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
restoration O
of O
sensorimotor O
plasticity O
of O
M1, O
we O
conducted O
an O
additional O
study O
looking O
at O
changes O
in O
LIDs O
and O
PAS-induced O
plasticity O
after O
10 O
sessions O
of O
either O
bilateral, O
real O
inhibitory O
cerebellar O
stimulation O
or O
sham O
stimulation. O
Only O
real O
and O
not O
sham O
stimulation O
had O
an O
antidyskinetic O
effect O
and O
it O
was O
paralleled O
by O
a O
resurgence O
in O
the O
sensorimotor O
plasticity O
of O
M1. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
alterations O
in O
cerebellar O
sensory O
processing O
function, O
occurring O
secondary O
to O
abnormal O
basal O
ganglia O
signals O
reaching O
it, O
may O
be O
an O
important O
element O
contributing O
to O
the O
maladaptive O
sensorimotor O
plasticity O
of O
M1 O
and O
the O
emergence O
of O
abnormal B

We O
describe O
a O

The O
negative O
effects O
of O
Bisphenol O
A O
(BPA) O
on O
neurodevelopment O
and O

have O
been O
well O
established. O
Acetylcholinesterase O
(AChE) O
is O
a O
regulatory O
enzyme O
which O
is O
involved O
in O
anxiety-like B
behavior. O
This O
study O
investigated O
behavioral O
phenotypes O
and O
AChE O
activity O
in O
male O
mice O
following O
BPA O
exposure O
during O
puberty. O
On O
postnatal O

(PND) O
35, O
male O
mice O
were O
exposed O
to O
50mg O
BPA/kg O
diet O
per O
day O
for O
a O
period O
of O
35 O
days. O
On O
PND71, O
a O
behavioral O
assay O
was O
performed O
using O
the O
elevated O

(EPM) O
and O
the O
light/dark O
test. O
In O
addition, O
AChE O
activity O
was O
measured O
in O
the O
prefrontal O
cortex, O
hypothalamus, O
cerebellum O
and O
hippocampus. O
Results O
from O
our O
behavioral O
phenotyping O
indicated O
that O
anxiety-like O
behavior O
was O
increased O
in O
mice O
exposed O
to O
BPA. O
AChE O
activity O
was O
significantly O
decreased O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
of O
mice O
with O
BPA O
compared O
to O
control O
mice, O
whereas O
no O
difference O
was O
found O
in O
the O
prefrontal O
cortex, O
hypothalamus O
and O
cerebellum. O
Our O
findings O
showed O
that O
pubertal O
BPA O
exposure O
increased O
anxiety-like O
behavior, O
which O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
decreased O
AChE O
activity O
of O
the O
hippocampus O
in O
adult O

We O
studied O
the O
prevalence O
and O
predictors O
of O
levodopa-induced O
dyskinesia O
among O
multiethnic O
Malaysian O
patients O
with O
PD. O
METHODS: O
This O
is O
a O
cross-sectional O
study O
involving O
95 O
patients O
with O
PD O
on O
uninterrupted O
levodopa O
therapy O
for O
at O

6 O
months. O
The O
instrument O
used O
was O
the O
UPDRS O
questionnaires. O
The O
predictors O
of O
dyskinesia O
were O
determined O
using O
multivariate O
logistic O
regression O
analysis. O
RESULTS: O
The O
mean O
age O
was O
65.6 O
+ O
8.5 O
years. O
The O
mean O
onset O
age O
was O
58.5 O
+ O
9.8 O
years. O
The O
median O
disease O
duration O
was O
6 O
(7) O
years. O
Dyskinesia B
was O
present O
in O
44% O
(n O

years. O
There O
were O
64.3% O
Chinese, O
31% O
Malays, O

3.7% O
Indians O
and O
other O
ethnic O
groups. O
Eighty-one O
percent O
of O
patients O
with O
dyskinesia O
had O
clinical O
fluctuations. O
Patients O
with O
dyskinesia O
had O
lower O

and O
higher O
total O
UPDRS O
scores O
( O
p O

The O
three O
significant O
predictors O
of O
dyskinesia O
were O
duration O
of O
levodopa O
therapy, O

dose. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
prevalence O
of O
levodopa-induced O
dyskinesia O
in O
our O
patients O
was O
44%. O
The O
most O
significant O
predictors O
were O
duration O
of O
levodopa O
therapy, O
total O
daily O
levodopa O
dose, O
and O
onset O
age. O

However, O
the O

Of O
the O
407 O
Yellow O

were O
found O
to O
have O
features O
of O

and O
18 O
(17%) O
had O
Fanconi O

The O
median O
TDF O

PURPOSE: O
Postoperative B
delirium B
is O
a O
recognized O
complication O
in O
populations O
at O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
is O
to O
assess O
the O
prevalence O
of O
early O
postoperative B
delirium I
in O
a O
population O
without O

admitted O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O

outcome O
investigated O
is O
to O
identify O
eventual O

METHODS: O
An O
observational, O
prospective O
study O
was O
conducted O
on O
a O
consecutive O
cohort O
of O
patients O
admitted O
to O
our O
ICU O
within O

Exclusion O
criteria O
were O
any O
preexisting O
predisposing O

scale O
for O
3 O
days O
after O
the O

were O
then O
assessed O
through O
three O

RESULTS: O
According O
to O
the O
confusion O
assessment O
method O
for O
the O
ICU O
scale, O
28 O
% O
of O
patients O
were O
diagnosed O
with O
early O
postoperative O
delirium. O
The O
use O
of O
thiopentone O
was O
significantly O
associated O
with O
an O
eight-fold-higher O
risk O
for O
delirium O
compared O
to O
propofol O
(57.1% O

CONCLUSION: O
In O
this O
study O
early O
postoperative O
delirium O
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
very O
common O
complication O
after O
major O
surgery, O
even O
in O
a O
population O

risk. O

A O
single O
neurotoxic B
dose O
of O
methamphetamine O
induces O
a O
long-lasting O
depressive-like B
behaviour O
in O
mice. O

Methamphetamine O
(METH) O
triggers O
a O
disruption O
of O
the O
monoaminergic O
system O
and O
METH O
abuse O
leads O
to O
negative O
emotional O
states O
including O
depressive B
symptoms I
during O
drug O
withdrawal. O
However, O
it O
is O
currently O
unknown O
if O
the O
acute O
toxic O
dosage O
of O
METH O
also O
causes O
a O
long-lasting O
depressive O
phenotype O
and O
persistent O
monoaminergic O
deficits. O
Thus, O
we O
now O
assessed O
the O
depressive-like O
behaviour O
in O
mice O
at O
early O
and O
long-term O
periods O
following O
a O
single O
high O
METH O
dose O
(30 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.). O
METH O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
motor O
function O
and O
procedural O
memory O
of O
mice O
as O
assessed O
by O
swimming O
speed O
and O
escape O
latency O
to O
find O
the O
platform O
in O
a O
cued O
version O
of O
the O
water O
maze O
task. O
However, O
METH O
significantly O
increased O
the O
immobility O
time O
in O
the O
tail O
suspension O
test O
at O
3 O
and O
49 O
days O
post-administration. O
This O
depressive-like O
profile O
induced O
by O
METH O
was O
accompanied O
by O
a O
marked O
depletion O
of O
frontostriatal O
dopaminergic O
and O
serotonergic O
neurotransmission, O
indicated O
by O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
dopamine, O
DOPAC O
and O
HVA, O
tyrosine O
hydroxylase O
and O
serotonin, O
observed O
at O
both O
3 O
and O
49 O
days O
post-administration. O
In O
parallel, O
another O
neurochemical O
feature O
of O
depression--astroglial B
dysfunction--was O
unaffected O
in O
the O
cortex O
and O
the O
striatal O
levels O
of O
the O
astrocytic O
protein O
marker, O
glial O
fibrillary O
acidic O
protein, O
were O
only O
transiently O
increased O
at O
3 O
days. O
These O
findings O
demonstrate O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
a O
single O
high O
dose O
of O
METH O
induces O
long-lasting O
depressive-like O
behaviour O
in O
mice O
associated O
with O
a O
persistent O
disruption O
of O
frontostriatal O
dopaminergic O
and O
serotonergic O
homoeostasis. O

Linezolid-induced O

This O
is O

relevant O
in O

where O
more O
than O
one O

can O
cause O
a O

We O
describe O
a O
case O
of O

A O
45-year-old O

who O
was O
on O
treatment O
with O
multiple O

anti-tuberculous O
drugs O
including O
linezolid O
and O

(XDR-TB) O
presented B
to O
us O
with O
painless O
progressive O
loss O
of O
vision O
in O
both O
eyes. O
Color O
vision O
was O
defective O
and O
fundus O
examination O
revealed O
optic B
disc I
edema I
in O
both O
eyes. O
Ethambutol-induced O
toxic B
optic I
neuropathy I
was O
suspected O
and O
tablet O
ethambutol O
was O
withdrawn. O
Deterioration B
of I
vision I
occurred O
despite O
withdrawal O
of O
ethambutol. O
Discontinuation O
of O
linezolid O
resulted O
in O
marked O

(LAST). O
METHODS: O
Newborn O
piglets O
received O
levobupivacaine O
until O
cardiovascular B
collapse I
occurred. O
Standard O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
was O
started O
and O
electrocardiogram O
(ECG) O
was O
monitored O
for O
ventricular B
tachycardia, I

Piglets O
were O
then O
randomly O
allocated O
to O
four O
groups: O
control O
(saline), O
Intralipid( O
) O
alone, O
epinephrine O
alone, O
or O
a O
combination O
of O
Intralipd O
plus O
epinephrine. O
Resuscitation O
continued O
for O
30 O
min O
or O
until O
there O
was O
a O
return O
of O
spontaneous O
circulation O
(ROSC) O
accompanied O
by O
a O
mean O
arterial O
pressure O
at O
or O
superior O
to O
the O
baseline O
pressure O
and O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
for O
a O
period O
of O
30 O
min. O
RESULTS: O
ROSC O
was O
achieved O
in O
only O
one O
of O
the O
control O
piglets O
compared O
with O
most O
of O
the O
treated O
piglets. O
Mortality O
was O
not O
significantly O
different O
between O
the O
three O
treatment O
groups, O
but O
was O
significantly O
lower O
in O
all O
the O
treatment O
groups O
compared O
with O
control. O
The O
number O
of O
ECG O
abnormalities O
was O
zero O
in O
the O
Intralipid O

14 O
and O
17, O
respectively, O
in O
the O

(P<0.05). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Lipid O
emulsion O
with O
or O
without O

INTRODUCTION: O
Diazinon O
Yis O
one O
of O
the O
most O
broadly O
used O
organophosphorus O
insecticides O
in O
agriculture. O
It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
exposure O
to O
diazinon O
may O
interfere O
with O
lipid O
metabolism. O
Moreover, O
the O
hypolipidemic O
effect O
of O
crocin O
has O
been O
established. O
Earlier O
studies O
revealed O
the O
major O
role O
of O
Extracellular O
signal-regulated O
kinase O
(ERK) O
pathways O
in O
low-density O
lipoprotein O
receptor O
(LDLr) O
expression. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
changes O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
lipid O
metabolism, O
ERK O
and O
LDLr O
expression O
in O
the O
liver O
of O
rats O
exposed O
to O
subacute O
diazinon. O
Furthermore O
ameliorating O
effect O
of O
crocin O
on O
diazinon O
induced O
disturbed O
cholesterol O
homeostasis O
was O
studied. O
METHODS: O
24 O
Rats O
were O
divided O
into O
4 O
groups O
and O
received O
following O
treatments O
for O
4 O
weeks; O
Corn O
oil O
(control), O
diazinon O
(15mg/kg O
per O
day, O
orally) O
and O
crocin O
(12.5 O
and O
25mg/kg O
per O
day, O
intraperitoneally) O
in O
combination O
with O
diazinon O
(15 O
mg/kg). O
The O
levels O
of O
cholesterol, O
triglyceride O
and O
LDL O
in O
blood O
of O
rats O
were O
analyzed. O
Moreover O
mRNA O
levels O
of O
LDLr O
and O
ERK1/2 O
as O
well O
as O
protein O
levels O
of O
total O
and O
activated O
forms O
of O
ERK1/2 O
in O
rat O
liver O
were O
evaluated O
by O
Western O

and O
quantitative O
real O

polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
analysis. O
RESULTS: O
Our O
data O
showed O
that O
subacute O
exposure O
to O
diazinon O
significantly O
increased O
concentrations O
of O
cholesterol, O
triglyceride O
and O
LDL. O
Moreover O
diazinon O
decreased O
ERK1/2 O
protein O
phosphorylation O
and O
LDLr O
transcript. O
Crocin O
reduced O
inhibition O
of O
ERK O
activation O
and O
diazinon-induced O
hyperlipemia B
and O
increased O
levels O
of O
LDLr O
transcript. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Crocin O
may O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
novel O
protective O
agent O
in O
diazinon-induced O
hyperlipemia O
through O
modulating O
of O
ERK O

Ifosfamide O
related O
encephalopathy: B
the O
need O
for O
a O
timely O
EEG O
evaluation. O

BACKGROUND: O
Ifosfamide O
is O
an O
alkylating O
agent O
useful O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
cancers B
including O
sarcomas, B
lymphoma, B
gynecologic B
and I
testicular I
cancers. I
Encephalopathy B
has O
been O
reported O
in O
10-40% O
of O
patients O
receiving O
high-dose O
IV O
ifosfamide. O
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
highlight O
the O
role O
of O
electroencephalogram O
(EEG) O
in O
the O
early O
detection O
and O
management O
of O
ifosfamide O
related O
encephalopathy. B
METHODS: O
Retrospective O
chart O
review O
including O
clinical O
data O
and O
EEG O
recordings O
was O
done O
on O
five O
patients, O
admitted O
to O
MD O
Anderson O
Cancer B
Center O
between O
years O
2009 O
and O
2012, O
who O
developed O
ifosfamide O
related O
acute O
encephalopathy. O
RESULTS: O
All O
five O
patients O
experienced O
symptoms O
of O
encephalopathy O
soon O
after O
(within O
12 O
h-2 O
days) O
receiving O
ifosfamide. O
Two O
patients O
developed O
generalized O
convulsions B
while O
one O
patient O
developed O
continuous O
non-convulsive B
status I
epilepticus I
(NCSE) O
that B
required O
ICU O
admission O
and O
intubation. O
Initial O
EEG O
showed O
epileptiform O
discharges O
in O
three O
patients; O
run O
of O
triphasic O
waves O
in O
one O
patient O
and O
moderate O
degree O
diffuse O
generalized O
slowing. O
Mixed O
pattern O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
both O
sharps O
and O
triphasic O
waves O
were O
also O
noted. O
Repeat O
EEGs O
within O
24_h O
of O
symptom O
onset O
showed O
marked O
improvement O
that O
was O
correlated O
with O
clinical O
improvement. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Severity O
of O
ifosfamide O
related O
encephalopathy O
correlates O
with O
EEG O
changes. O
We O
suggest O
a O
timely O
EEG O
evaluation O
for O
patients O
receiving O
ifosfamide O
who O
develop O
features O
of O
encephalopathy. O

were O
investigated. O
RESULTS: O
CIN O
was O
detected O
in O
18/90 O
(20 O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
report O
a O
case O
of O
syndrome B
of I
inappropriate I
anti-diuretic I

(SIADH) O
secretion B
associated O
with O
desvenlafaxine. O
CASE O
SUMMARY: O
A O
57-year O
old O
female O
with O
hyponatraemia. B
Her O
medications O
included O
desvenlafaxine, O
and O
symptoms O
included O
nausea, B
anxiety B
and O
confusion. B
The O
serum O
sodium O
at O
this O
time O
was O
120 O
mmol/L, O
serum O
osmolality O
was O
263 O
mosmol/kg, O
urine O
osmolality O
410 O
mosmol/kg O
and O
urine O
sodium O
63 O
mmol/L, O
consistent O
with O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
SIADH. O
Desvenlafaxine O
was O
ceased O
and O
fluid O
restriction O
implemented. O
After O
4 O
days O
the O
sodium O
increased O
to O
128 O
mmol/L O
and O
fluid O
restriction O
was O
relaxed. O
During O
her O
further O
3 O
weeks O
inpatient O
admission O
the O
serum O
sodium O
ranged O
from O
134 O
to O
137 O
mmol/L O
during O
treatment O
with O
mirtazapine. O
DISCUSSION: O
SIADH O
has O
been O
widely O
reported O
with O
a O
range O
of O
antidepressants. O
This O
case O
report O
suggests O
that O
desvenlafaxine O
might O
cause O
clinically O
significant O
hyponatremia. B
CONCLUSIONS: O
Clinicians O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
potential O
for O
antidepressants O
to O
cause O
hyponatremia,and O
take O
appropriate O
corrective O
action O
where O
necessary. O

Oxidative O

The O
mechanism O
of O
doxorubicin O
(DOX)-induced O
cardiotoxicity B
remains B
controversial. O
Wistar O

a O
single O

of O
DOX O
(4 O

to O
determine O
the O
DOX O
acute O
effect O
and O
(2) O
rats O
(n O

58) O
received O
4 O
injections O
of O
DOX O
(4 O

and O
were O
killed O
before O
the O
first O
injection O
(M0) O
and O
1 O
week O
after O
each O
injection O
(M1, O
M2, O
M3, O
and O
M4) O
to O
determine O
the O
chronological O
effects. O
Animals O
used O
at O
M0 O
(n O
= O
8) O
were O
also O
used O
at O
moment O
-24 O
h O
of O
acute O
study. O
Cardiac O
total O
antioxidant O
performance O
(TAP), O
DNA O
damage, O
and O
morphology O
analyses O
were O
carried O
out O
at O
each O
time O
point. O
Single O
dose O
of O
DOX O
was O
associated O
with O
increased O
cardiac B
disarrangement, I
necrosis, B
and O
DNA O
damage O
(strand O
breaks O
(SBs) O
and O
oxidized O
pyrimidines) O
and O
decreased O
TAP. O
The O
chronological O
study O
showed O
an O
effect O
of O
a O
cumulative O
dose O
on O
body O
weight O
(R O
= O
-0.99, O
p O
= O
0.011), O
necrosis O
(R O
= O
1.00, O
p O
= O
0.004), O
TAP O
(R O

0.95, O
p O
= O
0.049), O
and O
DNA O
SBs O
(R O
= O
-0.95, O
p O
= O
0.049). O
DNA O
SBs O
damage O
was O
negatively O
associated O
with O
TAP O
(R O
= O
-0.98, O
p O
= O
0.018), O
and O
necrosis O
(R O
= O
-0.97, O
p O
= O
0.027). O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
oxidative O
damage O
is O
associated O
with O
acute O
cardiotoxicity O
induced O
by O
a O
single O
dose O
of O
DOX O
only. O
Increased O
resistance O
to O
the O
oxidative O
stress O
is O
plausible O
for O
the O
multiple O
dose O
of O
DOX. O
Thus, O
different O
mechanisms O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
acute O
toxicity O
versus O
chronic O
toxicity. O

laboratory O
data O
of O
27 O
consecutive O
children O
who O
underwent O
LT O
from O
January O
2007 O

December O
2010 O
in O
our O
center O
were O
analyzed O
retrospectively. O
Patients O
were O
divided O
into O
seizures O
group O
and O
a O
non-seizures O
group. O
Pre-operative, O
intra-operative, O
and O
post-operative O
data O
were O
collected. O
Seizures B
occurred O
in O
four O
children, O
an O
incidence O
of O
14.8%. O
All O
exhibited O
generalized O
tonic-clonic B
seizures I
within O
the O
first O
two O
wk O
after O
LT. O
Univariate O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
risk O
factors O
associated O
with O
seizures O
after O
pediatric O
LT O
included O
gender, O
pediatric O
end-stage B
liver I
disease I

before O
surgery, O
Child-Pugh O
score O
before O
surgery, O
serum O
total O
bilirubin O
after O
surgery, O
and O
trough O
TAC O
level. O
Multivariate O
analysis O
showed O
that O
trough O
TAC O
level O
was O
the O
only O
independent O
risk O
factor O
associated O
with O
the O
seizures. O
All O
children O
who O
experienced O
seizures O
survived O
with O
good O
graft O
function O
and O
remained O
seizure-free O
without O
anti-epileptic O
drugs B
over O
a O
mean O
follow-up O
period O
of O
33.7 O
+ O
14.6 O
months. O
High O
trough O
TAC O
level O
was O
the O
predominant O
factor O
that O
contributed O
to O
seizures O
in O
the O
early O
post-operative O
period O
after O
pediatric O
LT. O
High O
PELD O
and O
Child-Pugh O
scores O
before O
LT O
and O
high O
post-operative O
serum O

may O
be O
contributory O

factors O
for O
TAC-related O
seizures. O

The O
present O
experiments O
were O
performed O
to O
study O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
flavonoid O
apigenin O
(20 O
mg/kg O
intraperitoneally O
(i.p.), O
1 O
h O
before O
acquisition), O
on O
24 O
h O
retention O
performance O
and O
forgetting O
of O
a O
step-through O
passive O
avoidance O
task, O
in O
young O
male O
Wistar O
rats. O
There O
were O
no O
differences O
between O
saline- O
and O
apigenin-treated O
groups O
in O
the O
24 O
h O
retention O
trial. O
Furthermore, O
apigenin O
did O
not O
prevent O
the O
amnesia B
induced O
by O
scopolamine O
(1mg/kg, O
i.p., O
30 O
min O
before O
the O
acquisition). O
The O
saline- O
and O
apigenin-treated O
rats O
that O
did O
not O
step O
through O
into O
the O
dark O
compartment O
during O
the O
cut-off O
time O
(540 O
s) O
were O
retested O
weekly O
for O
up O
to O
eight O
weeks. O
In O
the O
saline O
treated O
group, O
the O
first O
significant O
decline O
in O
passive O
avoidance O
response O
was O
observed O
at O
four O
weeks, O
and O
complete O
memory B
loss I
was O
found O
five O
weeks O
after O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
passive O
avoidance O
task. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
experimental O
period, O
60% O
of O
the O
animals O
treated O
with O
apigenin O
still O
did O
not O
step O
through. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
1) O
apigenin O
delays O
the O
long-term O
forgetting O
but O
did O
not O
modulate O
the O
24 O
h O
retention O
of O
fear O
memory O
and O
2) O
the O
obtained O
beneficial O
effect O
of O
apigenin O
on O
the O
passive O
avoidance O
conditioning O
is O
mediated O
by O
mechanisms O
that O
do O
not O
implicate O
its O
action O
on O
the O
muscarinic O

system. O

Cholecystokinin-octapeptide O
(CCK-8), O
which O
is O
a O
typical O
brain-gut O
peptide, O
exerts O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
biological O
activities O
on O
the O
central O

system. O
We O
have O
previously O
reported O
that O
CCK-8 O
significantly O
alleviated O

and O
reversed O
spine O
density O
decreases O
in O
the O
CA1 O
region O
of O
the O

animals. O
Here, O
we O
investigated O
the O
effects O
of O
CCK-8 O
on O
long-term O
potentiation O
(LTP) O
in O
the O

Population O

(PS), O
which O
were O
evoked O
by O

were O
recorded O
in O
the O

region. O
Acute O

and O
CCK-8 O
(1ug, O
i.c.v.) O
restored O
the O
amplitude O
of O

that O
was O
attenuated O
by O
morphine O
injection. O
Furthermore, O
microinjection O
of O
CCK-8 O
(0.1 O
and O
1ug, O
i.c.v.) O
also O
significantly O
augmented O
hippocampal O

rats. O
Pre-treatment O
of O
the O
CCK2 O
receptor O
antagonist O
L-365,260 O
(10ug, O

reversed O
the O

but O
the O
CCK1 O
receptor O
antagonist O
L-364,718 O
(10ug, O

not. O
The O
present O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
CCK-8 O
attenuates O
the O
effect O
of O
morphine O
on O
hippocampal O
LTP O
through O

MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
Our O
study O
included O
patients O
who O
were O
administered O
30-60 O
mL O
of O

agent O
for O
percutaneous O
coronary O
angiography O
(PCAG), O
all O
with O
creatinine O
values O
between O
1.1 O
and O
3.1 O
mg/dL. O
Patients O
were O
divided O
into O
three O
groups O
and O
each O
group O
had O
20 O
patients. O
The O
first O
group O
of O
patients O
was O
administered O
isotonic O
sodium O
chloride; O
the O
second O
group O
was O
administered O
a O
solution O
that O
of O
5% O
dextrose O
and O
sodium O
bicarbonate, O
while O
the O
third O
group O
was O
administered O
isotonic O
sodium O
chloride O
before O
and O
after O
the O
contrast O
injection. O
The O
third O
group O
received O
an O
additional O
injection O
of O
diltiazem O
the O
day O
before O
and O
first O
2 O
days O
after O
the O
contrast O
injection. O
All O
of O
the O
patients' O
plasma O
blood O
urea O

RESULTS: O
The O
basal O
creatinine O
levels O
were O
similar O
for O
all O
three O
groups O
(p O
> O
0.05). O
Among O
a O
total O
of O
60 O
patients O
included O
in O
the O
study, O
16 O
patients O
developed O
acute B

We O
report O
a O
45-year-old O
lady O
with O
chronic B
kidney I
disease I
stage O
4 O
due O
to O
chronic O
tubulointerstial B
disease. I
She O
was O
admitted O
to O
our O
center O
for O
severe O
anemia B
due O
to O
menorrhagia B
and O
deterioration B
of I
renal I
function. I
She O
was O
infused O
three O
units O
of O
packed O
cells O
during O
a O
session O
of O
hemodialysis. O
Tranexamic O
acid O
(TNA) O
1 O
g O
8-hourly O
was O
administered O
to O
her O
to O
control O
bleeding B
per O
vaginum. O
Two O
hours O
after O
the O
sixth O
dose O
of O
TNA, O
she O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
generalized O
tonic B
clonic I
convulsions. B
TNA O
was O
discontinued. O
Investigations O
of O
the O
patient O
revealed O
no O
biochemical O
or O
structural O
central O
nervous B
system I
abnormalities I
that O
could O
have O
provoked O
the O
convulsions. O
She O
did O
not O
require O
any O
further O
dialytic O
support. O
She O
had O
no O
further O
episodes O
of O
convulsion O
till O
dis-charge O
and O
during O
the O
two O
months O
of O
follow-up. O
Thus, O
the O
precipitating O
cause O
of O
convulsions O
was O
believed O
to O
be O
an O
overdose B
of O
TNA. O

Pre-treatment O
of O
bupivacaine-induced O
cardiovascular B
depression I
using O
different O
lipid O
formulations O
of O
propofol. O

BACKGROUND: O
Pre-treatment O
with O
lipid O
emulsions O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
increase O
lethal O
doses O
of O
bupivacaine, O
and O
the O
lipid O
content O
of O
propofol O
may O
alleviate O
bupivacaine-induced O
cardiotoxicity. B
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
is O
to O
investigate O
the O
effects O
of O
propofol O
in O
intralipid O
or O
medialipid O
emulsions O
on O
bupivacaine-induced O
cardiotoxicity. O
METHODS: O
Rats O
were O
anaesthetised O
with O
ketamine O
and O
were O
given O
0.5 O
mg/kg/min O
propofol O
in O
intralipid O
(Group O
P), O
propofol O
in O
medialipid O
(Group O
L), O
or O
saline O
(Group O
C) O
over O
20 O
min. O
Thereafter, O
2 O
mg/kg/min O
bupivacaine O
0.5% O
was O
infused. O
We O
recorded O
time O
to O
first O
dysrhythmia B
occurrence, O
respective O
times O
to O
25% O
and O
50% O
reduction O
of O
the O
heart O
rate O
(HR) O
and O
mean O
arterial O
pressure, O
and O
time O
to O
asystole B
and O
total O
amount O
of O
bupivacaine O
consumption. O
Blood O
and O
tissue O
samples O
were O
collected O
following O
asystole. O
RESULTS: O
The O
time O
to O
first O
dysrhythmia O
occurrence, O
time O
to O
25% O
and O
50% O
reductions O
in O
HR, O
and O
time O
to O
asystole O
were O
longer O
in O
Group O
P O
than O
the O
other O
groups. O
The O
cumulative O
bupivacaine O
dose O
given O
at O
those O
time O
points O
was O
higher O
in O
Group O
P. O
Plasma O
bupivacaine O
levels O
were O
significantly O
lower O
in O
Group O
P O
than O
in O
Group O
C. O
Bupivacaine O
levels O
in O
the O
brain O
and O
heart O
were O
significantly O
lower O
in O
Group O
P O
and O
Group O
L O
than O
in O
Group O
C. O
CONCLUSION: O
We O
conclude O
that O
pre-treatment O
with O
propofol O
in O
intralipid, O
compared O
with O
propofol O
in O
medialipid O
or O
saline, O
delayed O
the O
onset O
of O
bupivacaine-induced O
cardiotoxic O
effects O
as O
well O
as O
reduced O
plasma O
bupivacaine O
levels. O
Further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
explore O
tissue O
bupivacaine O
levels O
of O
propofol O
in O
medialipid O
and O
adapt O
these O
results O
to O
clinical O
practice. O

Drug-Induced B
Acute I
Liver I
Injury I
Within O
12 O
Hours O
After O
Fluvastatin O
Therapy. O

Although O
statins O
are O
generally O
well-tolerated O
drugs, O
recent O
cases O
of O
drug-induced B
liver I
injury I
associated O
with O
their O
use O
have O
been O
reported. O
A O
52-year-old O
Chinese O
man O
reported O
with O
liver B
damage, I
which O
appeared O
12 O
hours O
after O
beginning O
treatment O
with O
fluvastatin. O
Patient O
presented O
with O
complaints O
of O
increasing O
nausea, B
anorexia, B
and O
upper O
abdominal B
pain. I
His O
laboratory O
values O
showed O
elevated O
creatine O
kinase O
and O
transaminases. O
Testing O
for O
autoantibodies O
was O
also O
negative. O
The O
liver O
biochemistries O
eventually O
normalized O
within O
3 O
weeks O
of O
stopping O
the O
fluvastatin. O
Therefore, O
when O
prescribing O
statins, O
the O
possibility O
of O
hepatic B
damage I
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account. O

Fluconazole O
associated O
agranulocytosis B
and O
thrombocytopenia. B

CASE: O
We O
describe O
a O
second O
case O
of O
fluconazole O
associated O
agranulocytosis B
with O
thrombocytopenia B
and O
recovery O
upon O
discontinuation O
of O
therapy. O
The O
patient O
began O
to O
have O
changes O
in O
white O
blood O
cells O
and O
platelets O
within O
48 O
h O
of O
administration O
of O
fluconazole O
and O
began O
to O
recover O
with O
48 O
h O
of O
discontinuation. O
This O
case O
highlights O
that O
drug-induced O
blood B
dyscrasias I
can O
occur O
unexpectedly O
as O
a O
result O
of O
treatment O
with O
a O
commonly O
used O
drug O
thought O
to O
be O
"safe". O
CONCLUSION: O
According O
to O
Naranjo's O
algorithm O
the O
likelihood O
that O
our O
patient's O
agranulocytosis O
and O
thrombocytopenia O
occurred O
as O
a O
result O
of O
therapy O
with O
fluconazole O
is O
probable, O
with O
a O
total O
of O
six O
points. O
We O
feel O
that O
the O
weight O
of O
the O

evidence O
of O
this O
evidence O
is O
strong. O

Within O
the O
48 O

following O
the O
gradual O
introduction O
of O

explanation, O
contrasting O
with O
the O
absence O
of O
a O

were O
dismissed. O
The O
withdrawal O
and O
the O
gradual O
reintroduction O
of O

2 O
weeks O
later, O
which O
led O
to O
another O

Because O
of O
a O

was O
defined O
as O
a O
transient O

characterised O
by O
abnormal B
involuntary I

The O

respectively. O
Epileptiform O

Dysfunctional B
overnight I

Sleep O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
consolidation O
and O
integration O
of O
memory O
in O
a O
process O
called O
overnight O

consolidation. O
Previous O
studies O
indicate O
that O
ecstasy O
users O
have O
marked O
and O
persistent O
neurocognitive O
and O
sleep-related B
impairments. I
We O
extend O
past O
research O
by O
examining O
overnight O
memory O
consolidation O
among O
regular O
ecstasy O
users O
(n=12) O
and O
drug O
naive O
healthy O
controls O
(n=26). O
Memory O
recall O
of O

was O
evaluated O
before O
and O
after O
a O
period O
of O
sleep, O
with O
and O
without O
interference O
prior O
to O
testing. O
In O
addition, O
we O
assessed O
neurocognitive O
performances O
across O
tasks O
of O
learning, O
memory O
and O
executive O
functioning. O
Ecstasy O
users O
demonstrated O
impaired B
overnight I
memory I
consolidation, O
a O
finding O
that O
was O
more O
pronounced O
following O
associative O
interference. O
Additionally, O
ecstasy O
users O
demonstrated O
impairments O
on O
tasks O
recruiting O
frontostriatal O
and O
hippocampal O
neural O
circuitry, O
in O
the O
domains O
of O
proactive O
interference O
memory, O
long-term O
memory, O
encoding, O
working O
memory O
and O
complex O
planning. O
We O
suggest O
that O
ecstasy-associated O
dysfunction O
in O
fronto-temporal O
circuitry O
may O
underlie O
overnight O

memory B
impairments I
in O
regular O

Normoammonemic O
encephalopathy: B
solely O
valproate O

mechanisms? O

A O
77-year-old O
woman O
presented O
with O
subacute O
onset O
progressive O
confusion, B
aggression, B
auditory B
hallucinations I
and O
delusions. B
In O
the O
preceding O
months, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
number O
of O
admissions O
with O
transient O
unilateral O
hemiparesis B
with O
facial O
droop, O
and O
had O
been O
started O
on O
valproate O
for O
presumed O
hemiplegic B
migraine. I
Valproate O
was O
withdrawn O
soon O
after O
admission O
and O
her O
cognitive O
abilities O
have O
gradually O
improved O
over O
3 O
months O
of O
follow-up. O
Valproate O
levels O
taken O
prior O
to O
withdrawal O
were O
subtherapeutic O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
normoammonaemic. O
EEG O
undertaken O
during O
inpatient O
stay O
showed O
changes O
consistent O
with O
encephalopathy, B
and O
low O
titre O
N-methyl-D-aspartate O
(NMDA) O
receptor O
antibodies O
were O
present O
in O
this O
patient. O
The O
possible O
aetiologies O
of O
valproate-induced O
encephalopathy O
and O
NMDA O
receptor-associated O
encephalitis B
present O
a O
diagnostic O
dilemma. O
We O
present O
a O
putative O
combinatorial O
hypothesis O
to O
explain O
this O
patient's O
symptoms. O

Cerebellar B
and I
oculomotor B
dysfunction I
induced O
by O
rapid O
infusion O
of O
pethidine. O

Pethidine O
is O
an O
opioid O
that O
gains O
its O
popularity O
for O
the O
effective O
pain B
control O
through O
acting O
on O
the O
opioid-receptors. O
However, O
rapid O
pain O
relief O
sometimes O
brings O
about O
unfavourable O
side O
effects O
that O
largely O
limit O
its O
clinical O
utility. O
Common O
side O
effects O
include O
nausea, B
vomiting B
and O
hypotension. B
In O
patients O
with O
impaired B
renal I
and I
liver I
function, I
and O
those O
who O
need O
long-term O
pain O
control, O
pethidine O
may O
cause O
excitatory O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS) O
effects O
through O
its O
neurotoxic B
metabolite, O
norpethidine, O
resulting O
in O
irritability B
and O
seizure B
attack. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
though O
not O
clinically O
apparent, O
pethidine O
potentially O
causes O
inhibitory O
impacts O
on O
the O
CNS O
and O
impairs O
normal O
cerebellar O
and O
oculomotor O
function O
in O
the O
short O
term. O
In O
this O
case O
report, O
we O
highlight O
opioid's O
inhibitory O
side O
effects O
on O
the O
cerebellar O
structure O
that O
causes O
dysmetria, B
dysarthria, B
reduced O

An O
84-year-old O
male O
received O
oral O
pilsicainide, O
a O
pure O

is O
rapidly O
absorbed O
from O
the O

most O
of O
it O
is O
excreted O
from O
the O

Although O
the O
patient's O
renal O
function O
was O
not O
highly O
impaired O
and O
the O
dose O
of O
pilsicainide O
was O
low, O
the O

disease. O
She O
was O
originally O
treated O
with O
induction O
chemotherapy O
followed O
by O
an O
autologous O
transplant. O
She O
developed O
relapsed O
disease O
10 O
months O
later O
with O
leukemic B
involvement. O
She O
was O
re-induced O
with O
nelarabine O
1500 O
mg/m(2) O
on O
days O
1, O
3, O
and O
5 O
with O
1 O

of O
IT O
cytarabine O
100 O
mg O
on O
day O
2 O
as O
central O

(CNS) O
prophylaxis. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
treatment, O
she O
was O
on O
continuous O
renal O
replacement O
therapy O
due O
to O
sequelae O
of O
tumor B
lysis I
syndrome I
(TLS). O
She B
tolerated O
therapy O
well, O
entered O
a O
complete O
remission, O
and O
recovered O
her O
renal O
function. O
She O
received O
a O
second O
cycle O
of O
nelarabine O
without O
additional O
IT O
prophylaxis O
one O
month O
later. O
A O
week O
after O
this O
second O
cycle, O
she O
noted O
numbness O
in O
her O
lower O
extremities. O
Predominantly O
sensory, O
though O
also O
motor O
and O
autonomic, O
peripheral B
neuropathy B
started O
in O
her O
feet, O
ascended O
proximally O
to O
the O
mid-thoracic O
region, O
and O
eventually O
included O
her O
distal O
upper O
extremities. O
A O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
(MRI) O
of O
her O
spine O
demonstrated O
changes O
from O
C2 O
to O
C6 O
consistent O
with O
subacute O
combined O
degeneration. O
Nelarabine O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
symptoms. O
Her O
neuropathy O
stabilized O
and O
showed O
slight O
improvement O
and O
ultimately O
received O
an O
unrelated, O
reduced-intensity O
allogeneic O
transplant O
while O
in O
complete O
remission, O
but O
relapsed O
disease O
10 O
weeks O
later. O
She O
is O
currently O
being O
treated O
with O
best O
supportive O
care. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
published O
case O
report O
of O
severe O
neurotoxicity O
caused O
by O
nelarabine O
in O
a O

Valproate-induced O
hyperammonemic B
encephalopathy B
in O
a O
renal O
transplanted O
patient. O

Neurological B
complications I
after O
renal O
transplantation O
constitute O
an O
important O
cause O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality. O
Their O
differential O
diagnosis O
is O
difficult O
and O
essential O
for O
subsequent O
patient's O
management. O
Valproate-induced O
hyperammonemic B
encephalopathy B
is O
an O
uncommon O
but O
serious O
effect O
of O
valproate O
treatment. O
Here, O
we O
describe O
the O
case O
of O
a O
15-year-old O
girl O
who O
was O
on O
a O
long-term O
therapy O
with O
valproate O
due O
to O
epilepsy B
and O
revealed O
impaired B
consciousness I
with O
hyperammonemia B
12 O
days O
after O
renal O
transplantation. O
After O
withdraw O
of O
valproate, O
patients' O
symptoms O
resolved O
within O
24 O
h. O
Clinicians O
should O
increase O
their O
awareness O
for O
potential O
complication O
of O
valproate, O
especially O
in O

patients. O

Necrotising B
fasciitis I
after O
bortezomib O
and O
dexamethasone-containing O

in O
an O

of O
Waldenstrom B
macroglobulinaemia. I

Bortezomib O
and O
high-dose O
dexamethasone-containing O
regimens O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
generally O
tolerable O
with O
few O
severe O
bacterial B

in O
patients O
with O
B-cell O
malignancies. B
However, O
information O
is O
limited O
concerning O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
regimen O
in O
elderly O
patients. O
We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
a O
76-year-old O
man O
with O
Waldenstrom B
macroglobulinaemia I
who O
suffered O
necrotising B
fasciitis I
without O
neutropenia B
after O
the O
combination O
treatment O
with O
bortezomib, O
high-dose O
dexamethasone O
and O
rituximab. O
Despite O
immediate O
intravenous O
antimicrobial O
therapy, O
he O
succumbed O
23 O
h O
after O
the O
onset. O
Physicians O
should O
recognise O
the O
possibility O
of O
fatal O
bacterial O
infections O
related O
to O
bortezomib O
plus O
high-dose O
dexamethasone O
in O
elderly O
patients, O
and O
we O
believe O
this O
case O
warrants O
further O
investigation. O

An O

in O
doxorubicin-induced O

Many O

yet O
biomarkers O
or O
functional O

of O
early O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
have O
utilized O
a O

doxorubicin O
(DOX)-induced O
cardiomyopathy, B
applying O
multiple O
approaches, O

followed O
by O
a O
4 O

Electron O
microscopy O
of O
the O
myocardium O
revealed O
subcellular B
degeneration I
and O
marked O
mitochondrial O

after O
a O

Histopathological O

revealed O
progressive O
cardiomyocyte B

extensive O

after O
two O
doses. O
Extensive O

(quantified O
by O

after O
two O

positively O
correlated O
with O

In O
summary, O
subcellular O
cardiomyocyte O

was O
the O
earliest O
marker, O
followed O
by O
progressive O
functional O

Myocardial O
contrast O

occurred O
later. O
However, O
all O

thus O
warrant O
further O
evaluation O
as O

Intradermal O
injections O
of O
glutamate O
and O
capsaicin O
are O
attractive O
to O
use O
in O
human O
experimental O
pain B
models O
because O
hyperalgesia B
and O
allodynia B
mimic O
isolated O
aspects O
of O

disorders. I
The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
reproducibility O
of O
these O
models. O
Twenty O
healthy O
male O
volunteers O
(mean O
age O
24 O
years; O
range O
18-38 O
years) O
received O
intradermal O
injections O
of O

in O
the O
volar O
forearm. O
Magnitudes O
of O

were O
investigated O
using O
von O
Frey O

Areas O
of O
secondary B
hyperalgesia I
and O
allodynia O
were O
quantified O
immediately O
after O
injection O
and O
after O
15, O
30 O
and O
60 O
min. O
Two O
identical O
experiments O
separated O
by O
at O

7 O
days O
were O
performed. O
Reproducibility O
across O
and O
within O
volunteers O
(inter- O

intra-individual O
variation, O
respectively) O
was O
assessed O
using O
intraclass O
correlation O
coefficient O
(ICC) O
and O
coefficient O
of O

(CV). O
Secondary O
pinprick O
hyperalgesia O
was O
observed O
as O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
the O
visual O
analogue O

to O
von O
Frey O

60 O
and O
100 O
g O
(P O
< O
0.001) O
after O
glutamate O
injection. O
For O
capsaicin, O
secondary O
pinprick O
hyperalgesia O
was O
detected O
with O
all O
von O
Frey O
gauges O
(P O
< O
0.001). O
Glutamate O
evoked O
reproducible O
VAS O
response O
to O
all O
von O
Frey O
gauges O
(ICC O
> O
0.60) O
and O
brush O
strokes O
(ICC O
> O
0.83). O
Capsaicin O
injection O
was O
reproducible O
for O
secondary O
hyperalgesia O
(ICC O
> O
0.70) O
and O
allodynia O
(ICC O
> O
0.71). O
Intra-individual O
variability O
was O
generally O
lower O
for O
the O
VAS O
response O
to O
von O
Frey O
and O
brush O
compared O
with O
areas O
of O
secondary O
hyperalgesia O
and O
allodynia. O
In O
conclusion, O
glutamate O
and O
capsaicin O
yield O
reproducible O
hyperalgesic B
and O
allodynic B
responses, O
and O
the O
present O
model O
is O
well O
suited O
for O
basic O
research, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
assessing O
the O

Ocular-specific O

glaucoma B
in O
murine O
glucocorticoid-induced O
glaucoma. O

Administration O
of O
glucocorticoids O
induces O
ocular B
hypertension I
in O
some O
patients. O
If O
untreated, O
these O
patients O
can O
develop O
a O
secondary O
glaucoma B
that O
resembles O
primary B
open-angle I
glaucoma I
(POAG). O
The B
underlying O
pathology O
of O
glucocorticoid-induced O
glaucoma O
is O
not O
fully O
understood, O
due O
in O
part O
to O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
animal O
model. O
Here, O
we O
developed O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
glucocorticoid-induced O
glaucoma O
that O
exhibits O
glaucoma O
features O
that O
are O
observed O
in O
patients. O
Treatment O
of O
WT O
mice O
with O
topical O
ocular O
0.1% O
dexamethasone O
led O
to O
elevation O
of O
intraocular O
pressure O
(IOP), O
functional O
and O
structural O
loss O
of O
retinal B
ganglion I
cells, O
and O
axonal B
degeneration, I
resembling O
glucocorticoid-induced O
glaucoma O
in O
human O
patients. O
Furthermore, O
dexamethasone-induced O
ocular O
hypertension O
was O
associated O
with O
chronic O
ER O
stress O
of O
the O
trabecular O
meshwork O
(TM). O
Similar O
to O
patients, O
withdrawal O
of O
dexamethasone O
treatment O
reduced O
elevated O
IOP O
and O
ER O
stress O
in O
this O
animal O
model. O
Dexamethasone O
induced O
the O
transcriptional O
factor O
CHOP, O
a O
marker O
for O
chronic O
ER O
stress, O
in O
the O
anterior O
segment O
tissues, O
and O
Chop O
deletion O
reduced O
ER O
stress O
in O
these O
tissues O
and O
prevented O
dexamethasone-induced O
ocular O
hypertension. O
Furthermore, O
reduction O
of O
ER O
stress O
in O
the O
TM O
with O
sodium O
4-phenylbutyrate O
prevented O
dexamethasone-induced O
ocular O
hypertension O
in O
WT O
mice. O
Our O
data O
indicate O
that O
ER O
stress O
contributes O
to O
glucocorticoid-induced O
ocular O
hypertension O
and O
suggest O
that O
reducing O
ER O
stress O
has O
potential O
as O
a O
therapeutic O
strategy O
for O
treating O
glucocorticoid-induced O
glaucoma. O

Effects O
of O
ginsenosides O
on O
opioid-induced O
hyperalgesia B
in O
mice. O

Opioid-induced O
hyperalgesia B
(OIH) O
is B
characterized O
by O
nociceptive O
sensitization O
caused O
by O
the O
cessation O
of O
chronic O
opioid O
use. O
OIH O
can O
limit O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
opioid O
analgesics O
and O
complicate O
withdrawal O
from O
opioid B
addiction. I
In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
the O
effects O
of O
Re, O
Rg1, O
and O
Rb1 O
ginsenosides, O
the O
bioactive O
components O
of O
ginseng, O
on O
OIH. O
OIH O
was O
achieved O
in O
mice O
after O
subcutaneous O
administration O
of O
morphine O
for O
7 O
consecutive O
days O
three O
times O
per O
day. O
During O
withdrawal O
(days O
8 O
and O
9), O
these O
mice O
were O
administered O
Re, O
Rg1, O
or O
Rb1 O
intragastrically O
two O
times O
per O
day. O
On O
the O
test O
day O
(day O
10), O
mice O
were O
subjected O
to O
the O
thermal O
sensitivity O
test O
and O
the O
acetic O
acid-induced O
writhing O
test. O
Re O
(300 O
mg/kg) O
inhibited O
OIH O
in O
both O
the O
thermal O
sensitivity O
test O
and O
the O
acetic O
acid-induced O
writhing O
test. O
However, O
the O
Rg1 O
and O
Rb1 O
ginsenosides O
failed O
to O
prevent O
OIH O
in O
either O
test. O
Furthermore, O
Rg1 O
showed O
a O
tendency O
to O
aggravate O
OIH O
in O
the O
acetic O
acid-induced O
writhing O
test. O
Our O
data O
suggested O
that O
the O
ginsenoside O
Re, O
but O
not O
Rg1 O
or O
Rb1, O
may O
contribute O
toward O
reversal O
of O
OIH. O

OBJECTIVE: O
Dexmedetomidine O
and O
propofol O
are O
commonly O
used O
sedatives O
in O
neurocritical O
care O
as O
they O
allow O
for O
frequent O
neurologic O
examinations. O
However, O
both O
agents O
are O
associated O
with O
significant O
hemodynamic O
side O
effects. O
The O
primary O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
is O
to O
compare O
the O
prevalence O

PATIENTS: O
Neurocritical O
care O
patients O
admitted O
between O
July O
2009 O

September O
2012 O
were O
evaluated O
and O
then O

MEASUREMENTS O
AND O
MAIN O
RESULTS: O
A O
total O
of O
342 O
patients O
(105 O
dexmedetomidine O
and O
237 O
propofol) O
were O
included O
in O
the O
analysis, O
with O
190 O
matched O
(95 O
in O
each O

The O
primary O
outcome O
of O
this O
study O
was O
a O
composite O
of O
severe O
hypotension B
(mean O
arterial O

and O
bradycardia B
(heart O

No O
difference O
in O
the O
primary O

outcome O
in O
both O
the O
unmatched O
(30% O

or O
matched O
cohorts O
(28% O

could O
be O
found. O
When O
analyzed O
separately, O
no O
differences O
could O
be O
found O
in O
the O
prevalence O
of O
severe O
hypotension O
or O

in O
either O
the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Severe O
hypotension O
and O
bradycardia O
occur O
at O
similar O
prevalence O
in O
neurocritical O
care O
patients O
who O
receive O
dexmedetomidine O
or O
propofol. O
Providers O
should O
similarly O
consider O
the O
likelihood O
of O

Hydroxytyrosol O
ameliorates O
oxidative O

and O
mitochondrial B
dysfunction I
in O
doxorubicin-induced O
cardiotoxicity B
in O
rats O
with O

cancer. I

Oxidative O
stress O
is O
involved O
in O
several O
processes O
including O
cancer, B
aging O
and O
cardiovascular B
disease, I
and O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
potentiate O
the O
therapeutic O
effect O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
doxorubicin. O
Doxorubicin O
causes O
significant O
cardiotoxicity B
characterized O
by O
marked O
increases O
in O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
mitochondrial B
dysfunction. I
Herein, O
we O
investigate O
whether O
doxorubicin-associated O
chronic O
cardiac B
toxicity I
can O
be O
ameliorated O
with O
the O
antioxidant O
hydroxytyrosol O
in O
rats O
with O
breast B
cancer. I
Thirty-six O
rats O
bearing O
breast B
tumors I
induced O
chemically O
were O
divided O
into O
4 O
groups: O
control, O
hydroxytyrosol O
(0.5mg/kg, O
5days/week), O
doxorubicin O
(1mg/kg/week), O
and O
doxorubicin O
plus O
hydroxytyrosol. O
Cardiac B

complexes O
I-IV O
and O
apoptosis-inducing O
factor, O
and O
oxidative O
stress O
markers O
have O
been O
analyzed. O
Hydroxytyrosol O
improved O
the O
cardiac B
disturbances I
enhanced O
by O
doxorubicin O
by O
significantly O
reducing O
the O
percentage O
of O
altered O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
hydroxytyrosol O
improve O
the O
mitochondrial O

This O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
hydroxytyrosol O
protect O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
examine O
the O
effects O
of O
dehydroepiandrosterone O
(DHEA) O
on O
animal O
models O
of O
schizophrenia. B
METHODS: O
Seventy O
Swiss O
albino O
female O
mice O
(25-35 O
g) O
were O
divided O
into O
4 O
groups: O
amphetamine-free O
(control), O
amphetamine, O
50, O
and O
100 O
mg/kg O
DHEA. O
The O
DHEA O
was O
administered O
intraperitoneally O
(ip) O
for O
5 O
days. O
Amphetamine O
(3 O
mg/kg O
ip) O
induced O
hyper B
locomotion, O
apomorphine O
(1.5 O
mg/kg O
subcutaneously O
[sc]) O
induced O
climbing, O
and O
haloperidol O
(1.5 O
mg/kg O
sc) O
induced O
catalepsy B
tests O
were O
used O
as O
animal O
models O
of O
schizophrenia. O
The O
study O
was O
conducted O
at O
the O
Animal O
Experiment O
Laboratories, O
Department O
of O
Pharmacology, O
Medical O
School, O
Eskisehir O
Osmangazi O
University, O
Eskisehir, O
Turkey O
between O
March O
and O
May O
2012. O
Statistical O
analysis O
was O
carried O
out O
using O
Kruskal-Wallis O
test O
for O
hyper O
locomotion, O
and O
one-way O
ANOVA O
for O
climbing O
and O
catalepsy O
tests. O
RESULTS: O
In O
the O
amphetamine-induced O
locomotion O
test, O
there O
were O
significant O
increases O
in O
all O
movements O
compared O
with O
the O
amphetamine-free O
group. O
Both O
DHEA O
50 O
mg/kg O
(p<0.05), O
and O
100 O
mg/kg O
(p<0.01) O
significantly O
decreased O
all O
movements O
compared O
with O
the O
amphetamine-induced O
locomotion O
group. O
There O
was O
a O
significant O
difference O
between O
groups O
in O
the O
haloperidol-induced O
catalepsy O
test O
(p<0.05). O
There O
was O
no O
significant O
difference O
between O
groups O
in O
terms O
of O
total O
climbing O
time O
in O
the O
apomorphine-induced O
climbing O
test O
(p>0.05). O
CONCLUSION: O
We O
observed O
that O
DHEA O
reduced O
locomotor O
activity O
and O
increased O
catalepsy O
at O
both O
doses, O
while O
it O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
climbing O
behavior. O
We O
suggest O
that O
DHEA O
displays O
typical O
neuroleptic-like O
effects, O
and O
may O
be O
used O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
schizophrenia. O

measured O
for O
2min O
every O
10min O

Dermal O
developmental O
toxicity B
of O
N-phenylimide O
herbicides O
in O
rats. O

BACKGROUND: O
S-53482 O
and O
S-23121 O
are O
N-phenylimide O
herbicides O
and O
produced O
embryolethality, B
teratogenicity B
(mainly O
ventricular B
septal I
defects I
and O
wavy O
ribs), O
and O
growth B
retardation I
in O
rats O
in O
conventional O
oral O
developmental O
toxicity B
studies. O
Our O
objective O
in O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
the O
compounds O
induce O
developmental O
toxicity O
via O
the O
dermal O
route, O
which O
is O
more O
relevant O
to O
occupational O
exposure, O
hence O
better O
addressing O
human O
health O
risks. O
METHODS: O
S-53482 O
was O
administered O
dermally O
to O
rats O
at O
30, O
100, O
and O
300 O
mg/kg O
during O
organogenesis, O
and O
S-23121 O
was O
administered O
at O
200, O
400, O
and O
800 O
mg/kg O
(the O
maximum O
applicable O
dose O
level). O
Fetuses O
were O
obtained O
by O
a O
Cesarean O
section O
and O
examined O
for O
external, O
visceral, O
and O
skeletal O
alterations. O
RESULTS: O
Dermal O
exposure O
of O
rats O
to O
S-53482 O
at O
300 O
mg/kg O
produced O
patterns O
of O
developmental O
toxicity O
similar O
to O
those O
resulting O
from O
oral O
exposure. O
Toxicity B
included O
embryolethality, O
teratogenicity, O
and O
growth O
retardation. O
Dermal O
administration O
of O
S-23121 O
at O
800 O
mg/kg O
resulted O
in O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
embryonic B
death I
and O
ventricular O
septal O
defect, O
but O
retarded O
fetal O
growth O
was O
not O
observed O
as O
it O
was O
following O
oral O
exposure O
to O
S-23121. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Based O
on O
the O
results, O
S-53482 O
and O
S-23121 O
were O
teratogenic O
when O
administered O
dermally O
to O
pregnant O
rats O
as O
were O
the O
compounds O
administered O
orally. O
Thus, O
investigation O
of O
the O
mechanism O
and O
its O
human O
relevancy O
become O
more O
important. O

Cancer B
Patients O
Receiving O
Cisplatin O
With O
and O
Without O
Mannitol. O

BACKGROUND: O
Cisplatin O
is O
a O
widely O
used O
antineoplastic. O
One O
of O
the O
major O
complications O
of O
cisplatin O
use O
is O
dose-limiting O
nephrotoxicity. B
There B
are O
many O
strategies O
to O
prevent O
this O
toxicity, O
including O
the O
use O
of O
mannitol O
as O
a O
nephroprotectant O
in O
combination O
with O
hydration. O
OBJECTIVE: O
We O
aimed O
to O
evaluate O
the O
rates O
of O
cisplatin-induced O
nephrotoxicity O
in O
cancer B
patients O
receiving O
single-agent O
cisplatin O
with O
and O
without O
mannitol. O
METHODS: O
This O
single-center O
retrospective O
analysis O
was O
a O
quasi O
experiment O
created O
by O
the O
national O
mannitol O
shortage. O
Data O
were O

on O
adult O
cancer O
patients O
receiving O
single-agent O
cisplatin O
as O
an O
outpatient O
from O
January O
2011 O
to O
September O
2012. O
The O
primary O

was O
acute B
kidney I

(AKI). O
RESULTS: B
We O
evaluated O
143 O
patients O
who O
received O
single-agent O
cisplatin; O
97.2% O
of O
patients O
had O
head B
and I
neck I
cancer I
as O
their O
primary O
malignancy. B
Patients O
who O
did O
not O
receive O
mannitol O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
develop O
nephrotoxicity: O

2.646 O
(95% O

Patients O
who O
received O
the O
100 O
mg/m(2) O
dosing O
and O
patients O
who O
had O
a O

respectively. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
When O
limited O
quantities O
of O
mannitol O
are O
available, O
it O
should O
preferentially O
be O
given O
to O
patients O
at O
particularly O
high O
risk O
of O
nephrotoxicity. O
Our O
analysis O
suggests O
that O
those O
patients O
receiving O
the O
dosing O
schedule O
of O
100 O
mg/m(2) O
cisplatin O
every O
3 O
weeks O
and O
those O
with O
hypertension O
are O
at O
the O
greatest O
risk O
of O
nephrotoxicity O
and O
would O
benefit O
from O
the O
addition O
of O
mannitol. O

Metformin O
protects O
against O
seizures, B
learning B
and I
memory B
impairments I
and O
oxidative O
damage O
induced O
by O
pentylenetetrazole-induced O
kindling O
in O
mice. O

Cognitive B
impairment, I
the O
most O
common O
and O
severe O
comorbidity O
of O
epilepsy, B
greatly O
diminishes O
the O
quality O
of O
life. O
However, O
current O
therapeutic O
interventions O
for O
epilepsy O
can O
also O
cause O
untoward O
cognitive O
effects. O
Thus, O
there O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
for O
new O
kinds O
of O
agents O
targeting O
both O
seizures B
and O
cognition B
deficits. I
Oxidative O
stress O
is O
considered O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
epileptogenesis O
and O
cognitive B
deficits, I
and O
antioxidants O
have O
a O
putative O
antiepileptic O
potential. O
Metformin, O
the O
most O
commonly O
prescribed O
antidiabetic O
oral O
drug, O
has O
antioxidant O
properties. O
This O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
evaluate O
the O
ameliorative O
effects O
of O
metformin O
on O
seizures, O
cognitive B
impairment I
and O
brain O
oxidative O
stress O
markers O
observed O
in O
pentylenetetrazole-induced O
kindling O
animals. O
Male O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
were O
administered O
with O
subconvulsive O
dose O
of O
pentylenetetrazole O
(37 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.) O
every O
other O
day O
for O
14 O
injections. O
Metformin O
was O
injected O
intraperitoneally O
in O
dose O
of O
200mg/kg O
along O
with O
alternate-day O
PTZ. O
We O
found O
that O
metformin O
suppressed O
the O
progression O
of O
kindling, O
ameliorated O
the O
cognitive O
impairment O
and O
decreased O
brain O
oxidative O
stress. O
Thus O
the O
present O
study O
concluded O
that O
metformin O
may O
be O
a O
potential O
agent O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
epilepsy O
as O
well O
as O
a O
protective O
medicine O
against O
cognitive O

induced O
by O
seizures. O

P53 O

AIMS: O
Doxorubicin O
(DOX) O
is O
an O
effective O
anti-cancer O
therapeutic, B
but O
is O
associated O
with O
both O
acute O
and O
late-stage O
cardiotoxicity. B
Children O
are O
particularly O
sensitive O
to O
DOX-induced O

Here, O
the O
impact O
of O
p53 O

on O
acute O
vs. O
late-stage O
DOX O
cardiotoxicity O
was O
examined O
in O
a O
juvenile O
model. O
METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
Two-week-old O
MHC-CB7 O
mice O
(which O
express O
dominant-interfering O
p53 O
in O
cardiomyocytes) O
and O
their O
non-transgenic O
(NON-TXG) O
littermates O
received O
weekly O
DOX O
injections O
for O
5 O
weeks O
(25 O
mg/kg O
cumulative O
dose). O
One O
week O
after O
the O
last O
DOX O
treatment O
(acute O
stage), O
MHC-CB7 O
mice O
exhibited O
improved O
cardiac O
function O
and O
lower O
levels O
of O
cardiomyocyte O
apoptosis O
when O
compared O
with O
the O
NON-TXG O
mice. O
Surprisingly, O
by O
13 O
weeks O
following O
the O
last O
DOX O
treatment O
(late O
stage), O
MHC-CB7 O
exhibited O
a O
progressive O
decrease O
in O
cardiac O
function O
and O
higher O
rates O
of O
cardiomyocyte O
apoptosis O
when O
compared O
with O
NON-TXG O
mice. O
p53 O
inhibition O
blocked O
transient O
DOX-induced O
STAT3 O
activation O
in O
MHC-CB7 O
mice, O
which O
was O
associated O
with O
enhanced O
induction O
of O
the O
DNA O
repair O
proteins O
Ku70 O
and O
Ku80. O
Mice O
with O
cardiomyocyte-restricted O
deletion O
of O
STAT3 O
exhibited O
worse O
cardiac O
function, O
higher O
levels O
of O
cardiomyocyte O
apoptosis, O
and O
a O
greater O
induction O
of O
Ku70 O
and O
Ku80 O
in O
response O
to O
DOX O
treatment O
during O
the O
acute O
stage O
when O
compared O
with O
control O
animals. O
CONCLUSION: O
These O
data O
support O
a O
model O
wherein O
a O
p53-dependent O
cardioprotective O
pathway, O
mediated O
via O
STAT3 O
activation, O
mitigates O
DOX-induced O
myocardial O
stress O
during O
drug O
delivery. O
Furthermore, O
these O
data O
suggest O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
how O
p53 O
inhibition O
can O
result O
in O
cardioprotection O
during O
drug O
treatment O
and, O
paradoxically, O
enhanced O
cardiotoxicity O
long O
after O
the O

Metronidazole-induced O
encephalopathy: B
an O
uncommon O
scenario. O

Metronidazole O
can O
produce O
neurological O
complications O
although O
it O
is O
not O
a O
common O
scenario. O
We O
present O
a O
case O
where O
a O
patient O
developed O
features O
of O
encephalopathy B
following O
prolonged O
metronidazole O
intake. O
Magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
(MRI) O
brain O
showed O
abnormal O
signal O
intensity O
involving O
both O
dentate O
nuclei O
of O
cerebellum O
and O
splenium O
of O
corpus O
callosum. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
metronidazole O
toxicity B
was O
made O
by O
the O
MRI O
findings O
and O
supported O
clinically. O

Aconitine-induced O
Ca2+ O
overload O
causes O
arrhythmia B
and O
triggers O
apoptosis O
through O
p38 O
MAPK O
signaling O
pathway O
in O
rats. O

Aconitine O
is O
a O
major O
bioactive O
diterpenoid O
alkaloid O
with O
high O
content O
derived O
from O
herbal O
aconitum O
plants. O
Emerging O
evidence O
indicates O
that O
voltage-dependent O
Na(+) O
channels O
have O
pivotal O
roles O
in O
the O
cardiotoxicity B
of O
aconitine. O
However, O
no O
reports O
are O
available O
on O
the O
role O
of O
Ca(2+) O
in O
aconitine O
poisoning. B
In O
this O
study, O
we O
explored O
the O
importance O
of O
pathological O
Ca(2+) O
signaling O
in O
aconitine O
poisoning O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo. O
We O
found O
that O
Ca(2+) O
overload O
lead O
to O
accelerated O
beating O
rhythm O
in O
adult O
rat O
ventricular O
myocytes O
and O
caused O
arrhythmia B
in O
conscious O
freely O
moving O
rats. O
To O
investigate O
effects O
of O
aconitine O
on O
myocardial B
injury, I
we O
performed O
cytotoxicity B
assay O
in O
neonatal O
rat O
ventricular O
myocytes O
(NRVMs), O
as O
well O
as O
measured O
lactate O
dehydrogenase O
level O
in O
the O
culture O
medium O
of O
NRVMs O
and O
activities O
of O
serum O
cardiac O
enzymes O
in O
rats. O
The O
results O
showed O
that O
aconitine O
resulted O
in O
myocardial O
injury O
and O
reduced O
NRVMs O
viability O
dose-dependently. O
To O
confirm O
the O
pro-apoptotic O
effects, O
we O
performed O
flow O
cytometric O
detection, O
cardiac O
histology, O
transmission O
electron O
microscopy O
and O
terminal O
deoxynucleotidyl O
transferase-mediated O
dUTP-biotin O
nick O
end O
labeling O
assay. O
The O
results O
showed O
that O
aconitine O
stimulated O
apoptosis O
time-dependently. O
The O
expression O
analysis O
of O
Ca(2+) O
handling O
proteins O
demonstrated O
that O
aconitine O
promoted O
Ca(2+) O
overload O
through O
the O
expression O
regulation O
of O
Ca(2+) O
handling O
proteins. O
The O
expression O
analysis O
of O
apoptosis-related O
proteins O
revealed O
that O
pro-apoptotic O
protein O
expression O
was O
upregulated, O
and O
anti-apoptotic O
protein O
BCL-2 O
expression O
was O
downregulated. O
Furthermore, O
increased O
phosphorylation O
of O
MAPK O
family O
members, O
especially O
the O
P-P38/P38 O
ratio O
was O
found O
in O
cardiac O
tissues. O
Hence, O
our O
results O
suggest O
that O
aconitine O
significantly O
aggravates O
Ca(2+) O
overload O
and O
causes O
arrhythmia O
and O
finally O
promotes O
apoptotic O
development O
via O
phosphorylation O
of O
P38 O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase. O

Chronic O

Acute O
treatment O
with O
metformin O
has O
a O
protective O
effect O
in O
myocardial B

In O
the O

the O
effect O

on O
cardiac B

and O
toll-like O
receptor O
4 O
(TLR4) O
activities O
following O
myocardial O

and O
their O
relation O
with O

were O
assessed. O
Male O

were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
one O
of O
5 O
groups O
(n=6): O
normal O

and O
groups O
were O
injected O
isoproterenol O
after O
chronic O
pre-treatment O
with O
0, O
25, O
50, O
or O
100mg/kg O
of O
metformin O
twice O
daily O
for O
14 O
days. O
Isoproterenol O
(100mg/kg) O
was O
injected O
subcutaneously O
on O
the O
13th O
and O
14th O
days O
to O
induce O
acute B
myocardial I
infarction. I
Isoproterenol O
alone O
decreased O
left O
ventricular O
systolic O
pressure O
and O
myocardial O
contractility O
indexed O
as O
LVdp/dtmax O
and O
LVdp/dtmin. O
The O
left B
ventricular I
dysfunction I
was O
significantly O
lower O
in O
the O
groups O
treated O
with O
25 O
and O
50mg/kg O
of O
metformin. O
Metfromin O
markedly O
lowered O
isoproterenol-induced O
elevation O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
TLR4 O
mRNA, O
myeloid O
differentiation O
protein O
88 O
(MyD88), O
tumor B

(TNF-a), O
and O
interleukin O

in O
the O
heart O
tissues. O
Similar O
changes O
were O
also O
seen O
in O
the O
serum O
levels O
of O
TNF-a O
and O
IL-6. O
However, O
the O
lower O
doses O
of O
25 O
and O
50mg/kg O
were O
more O
effective O
than O
100mg/kg. O
Phosphorylated O
AMPKa O
(p-AMPK) O
in O
the O
myocardium O
was O
significantly O
elevated O
by O
25mg/kg O
of O
metformin, O
slightly O
by O
50mg/kg, O
but O
not O
by O
100mg/kg. O
Chronic O
pre-treatment O
with O
metformin O
reduces O
post-myocardial O
infarction O
cardiac O
dysfunction O
and O
suppresses O
inflammatory O
responses, O
possibly O
through O
inhibition O
of O
TLR4 O
activities. O
This O
mechanism O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
target O
to O
protect O
infarcted O
myocardium. O

describe O
the O
case O
of O
an O
81-year-old O
Japanese O

with O
tiapride O
(75 O
mg/day) O
and O
tetrabenazine O
(12.5 O

The O
patient O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
tiapride O
or O
tetrabenazine O
alone O
without O
any O
adverse O
effects O
before O
the O
administration O
of O
the O

She O
also O
had O
advanced O
breast B

when O
the O
combination O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
the O
occurrence O
of O
neuroleptic O
malignant O
syndrome O
due O
to O
combination O
therapy O
with O
tetrabenazine O
and O
tiapride O
has O
not O
been O

It O
was O
subsequently O
changed O
to O

remained O
normal. O
By O
inhibiting O
the O
cytochrome O

2D6, O
terbinafine O
had O
decreased O
metoprolol's O
clearance, O
leading O
in O

at O
doses O
25mg/kg O
(20.12 O

In O
addition, O
GABA O

GFC75 O
plus O
P400 O
showed O
an O
increase O
of O
46.90% O
when O

In O
aspartate, O
glutamine O

21.80%, O
respectively O
in O
mice O

P400 O
when O
compared O

Hippocampus O
mice O
treated O

P400 O
showed O
an O
increase O
in O
AChE O
activity O
(63.30%) O
when O
compared O

The O
results O
indicate O
that O
GFC O
can O
exert O
anticonvulsant O
activity O
and O
reduce O
the O
frequency O
of O

as O
demonstrated O
by O
increase O

and O
decrease O
in O
mortality O
rate O
of O
animals. O
In O
conclusion, O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
GFC O
may O
influence O
in O
epileptogenesis O
and O
promote O
anticonvulsant O
actions O
in O
pilocarpine O
model O
by O
modulating O
the O
GABA O

This O
compound O
may O
be O
useful O
to O

triple O
therapy O
with O
ribavirin, O
pegylated O
interferon O
and O
telaprevir. O
The O
patient O
also O
received O
simvastatin. O
One O
month O
after O
starting O
the O
antiviral O
therapy, O
the O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
because O
he O
developed O
rhabdomyolysis. B
At O
admission O
simvastatin O
and O
all O
antiviral O
drugs O
were O
discontinued O
because O
toxicity B
due O
to O
a O
drug-drug O
interaction O
was O
suspected. O
The O
creatine O
kinase O
peaked O
at O
62,246 O
IU/L O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
intravenous O
normal O
saline. O
The O
patient's O
renal O
function O
remained O
unaffected. O
Fourteen O
days O
after O
hospitalization, O
creatine O
kinase O
level O
had O
returned O
to O
230 O
IU/L O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
discharged. O
Telaprevir O
was O
considered O
the O
probable O
causative O
agent O
of O
an O
interaction O
with O
simvastatin O
according O
to O
the O
Drug O
Interaction O
Probability O
Scale. O
The O
interaction O
is O
due O
to O
inhibition O
of O
CYP3A4-mediated O
simvastatin O
clearance. O
Simvastatin O
plasma O
concentration O
increased O
30 O
times O
in O
this O
patient O
and O
statin O
induced O
muscle B
toxicity I
is O
related O
to O
the O
concentration O
of O
the O
statin O
in O
blood. O
In O
conclusion, O
with O
this O
case O
we O
illustrate O
that O
telaprevir O
as O
well O
as O
statins O
are O
susceptible O
to O
clinical O
relevant O
drug-drug O
interactions. O

Kinin O
B2 O
receptor O
deletion O
and O
blockage O
ameliorates O
cisplatin-induced O
acute B
renal I
injury. I

Cisplatin O
treatment O
has O
been O
adopted O
in O
some O
chemotherapies; O
however, O
this O
drug O
can O
induce O
acute B
kidney I
injury I
due O
its O
ability O
to O
negatively O
affect O
renal O
function, O
augment O
serum O
levels O
of O
creatinine O
and O
urea, O
increase O
the O
acute B
tubular I
necrosis I
score O
and O
up-regulate O
cytokines O
(e.g., O
IL-1b O
and O
TNF-a). O
The O
kinin O
B2 O
receptor O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
the O
inflammation B
process, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
regulation O
of O
cytokine O
expression, O
and O
its O
deletion O
resulted O
in O
an O
improvement O
in O
the O
diabetic B
nephropathy I
status. O
To O
examine O
the O
role O
of O
the O
kinin O
B2 O
receptor O
in O
cisplatin-induced O
acute O
kidney O
injury, O
kinin O
B2 O
receptor O
knockout O
mice O
were O
challenged O
with O
cisplatin. O
Additionally, O
WT O
mice O
were O
treated O
with O
a O
B2 O
receptor O
antagonist O
after O
cisplatin O
administration. O
B2 O
receptor-deficient O
mice O
were O
less O
sensitive O
to O
this O
drug O
than O
the O
WT O
mice, O
as O
shown O
by O
reduced O
weight B
loss, I
better O
preservation O
of O
kidney O
function, O
down O
regulation O
of O
inflammatory O
cytokines O
and O
less O
acute O
tubular O
necrosis. O
Moreover, O
treatment O
with O
the O
kinin O
B2 O
receptor O
antagonist O
effectively O
reduced O
the O
levels O
of O
serum O
creatinine O
and O
blood O
urea O
after O
cisplatin O
administration. O
Thus, O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
kinin O
B2 O
receptor O
is O
involved O
in O
cisplatin-induced O
acute O
kidney O
injury O
by O
mediating O
the O
necrotic B
process O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
inflammatory O
cytokines, O
thus O
resulting O
in O
declined O
renal O
function. O
These O
results O
highlight O
the O
kinin O
B2 O
receptor O
antagonist O
treatment O
in O
amelioration O
of O
nephrotoxicity B
induced O
by O
cisplatin O
therapy. O

following O
succinylcholine O
administration. O

BACKGROUND: O
Succinylcholine O
commonly O
produces O
frequent O
adverse O
effects, O
including O
muscle B
fasciculation B
and O
myalgia. B
The O
current O
study O
identified O
the O
optimal O
dose O
of O
rocuronium O
to O
prevent O
succinylcholine-induced O
fasciculation O
and O
myalgia O
and O
evaluated O
the O
influence O
of O
rocuronium O
on O
the O
speed O
of O
onset O
produced O
by O
succinylcholine. O
METHODS: O
This O
randomized, O
double-blinded O
study O
was O
conducted O
in O
100 O
patients O
randomly O
allocated O
into O
five O
groups O
of O
20 O
patients O
each. O
Patients O
were O
randomized O
to O
receive O
0.02, O
0.03, O
0.04, O
0.05 O
and O
0.06 O
mg/kg O
rocuronium O
as O
a O
precurarizing O

All O
patients O
received O
succinylcholine O
1.5 O
mg/kg O
at O
2 O
minutes O
after O
the O
precurarization, O
and O
were O
assessed O
the O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
fasciculations, B
while O
myalgia O
was O
assessed O
at O
24 O
hours O
after O
surgery. O
RESULTS: O
The O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
visible O
muscle O
fasciculation O
was O
significantly O
less O
with O
increasing O
the O
amount O
of O
precurarizing O
dose O
of O
rocuronium O
(P O
< O
0.001). O
Those O
of O

tend O
to O
decrease O
according O
to O
increasing O
the O
amount O
of O
precurarizing O
dose O
of O
rocuronium, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
significance O
(P O

longer O
with O
increasing O
the O
amount O
of O
precurarizing O

0.001). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Precurarization O
with O
0.04 O
mg/kg O
rocuronium O
was O
the O
optimal O
dose O
considering O
the O

AQP2 O
and O
UT-A1 O
expression O
was O
lowered O
in O
6 O
week O
lithium-treated O
WT O
animals O
whereas O
in O

mice, O
AQP2 O
was O
only O
reduced O
by O
2-fold O

were O
elevated O
in O

WT O
but O
not O
in O

were O
treated O
with O
betaine O
(100, O

400 O
mg/kg) O
orally O
for O
40 O
days. O
Acute O

for O
two O
consecutive O
days. O
Serum O

Oral O
administration O
of O
betaine O
(200 O

significantly O
reduced O
the O
level O
of O

Furthermore, O
betaine O
(200 O

treatment O
increased O
the O
ventricular O

here. O
CASE O
REPORT: O
A O
62-year-old O
Taiwanese O
widow O
with O
bipolar B
disorder I
was O
diagnosed O
with O
hepatocellular O

with O
quetiapine. O
After O
quetiapine O
was O
discontinued, O
her O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Although O
neutropenia O
is O
not O
a O
common O
side O

of O
quetiapine, O
physicians O
should O
be O
cautious O
about O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
OBJECTIVES: O
This O
report O
aimed O
to O
present O
a O
case O
of O
lateral O
antebrachial O
cutaneous O
neuropathy B
(LACNP) O
that O
occurred O
after O
a O
steroid O
injection O
in O
the O
lateral O
epicondyle O
to O
treat O
lateral B
epicondylitis I
in O
a O
40-year-old O
woman. O
MATERIAL O
AND O
METHOD: O
A O
40-year-old O
woman O
presented O
with O
decreased O
sensation O
and O
paresthesia B
over O
her O
right O
lateral O
forearm; O
the O
paresthesia O
had O
occurred O
after O
a O
steroid O
injection O
in O
the O
right O
lateral O
epicondyle O
3 O
months O
before. O
Her O
sensation O
of O
light O
touch O
and O
pain B
was O
diminished O
over O
the O
lateral O
side O
of O
the O
right O
forearm O
and O

area. O
RESULTS: O
The O
sensory O
action O
potential O
amplitude O
of O
the O
right O
lateral O
antebrachial O
cutaneous O
nerve O
(LACN) O
(6.2 O
uV) O
was O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
the O
left O
(13.1 O
uV). O
The O
difference O
of O
amplitude O
between O
both O
sides O
was O
significant O
because O
there O
was O
more O
than O
a O
50% O
reduction. O
She O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
right O
LACNP O
(mainly O
axonal O
involvement) O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
clinical O
manifestation O
and O
the O
electrodiagnostic O
findings. O
Her O
symptoms O
improved O
through O
physical O
therapy O
but O
persisted O
to O
some O
degree. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
report O
describes O
the O
case O
of O
a O
woman O
with O
LACNP O
that O
developed O
after O
a O
steroid O

UNASSIGNED: O
Our O
previous O
study O
has O
indicated O
that O
prenatal O
caffeine O
exposure O
(PCE) O
could O
induce O
intrauterine B
growth I
retardation I
(IUGR) O
of B
offspring. O
Recent O
research O
suggested O
that O
IUGR O
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
glomerulosclerosis. B
However, O
whether O
PCE O
could O
induce O
glomerulosclerosis O
and O
its O
underlying O
mechanisms O
remain O
unknown. O
This O
study O
aimed O
to O
demonstrate O
the O
induction O
to O
glomerulosclerosis O
in O
adult O
offspring O
by O
PCE O
and O
its O
intrauterine O
programming O
mechanisms. O
A O
rat O
model O
of O
IUGR O
was O
established O
by O
PCE, O
male O
fetuses O
and O
adult O
offspring O
at O
the O
age O
of O
postnatal O
week O
24 O
were O
euthanized. O
The O
results O
revealed O

BACKGROUND: O
Millions O
of O
individuals O
worldwide, O
particularly O
those O
living O
in O
rural O
and O
developing O
areas, O
are O
exposed O
to O
harmful O
levels O
of O
inorganic O
arsenic O
(iAs) O
in O
their O
drinking O
water. O
Inorganic O
As O
exposure O
during O
key O
developmental O
periods O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
adverse O
health O
effects O
including O
those O
that O
are O
evident O
in O
adulthood. O
There O
is O
considerable O
interest O
in O
identifying O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
that O
relate O
early-life O
iAs O
exposure O
to O
the O
development O
of O
these O
latent O
diseases, O
particularly O
in O
relationship O
to O
cancer. B
OBJECTIVES: O
This O
work O
summarizes O
research O
on O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
that O
underlie O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
cancer O
development O
in O
adulthood O
that O
is O
associated O
with O
early-life O
iAs O
exposure. O
DISCUSSION: O
Epigenetic O
reprogramming O
that O
imparts O
functional O
changes O
in O
gene O
expression, O
the O
development O
of O
cancer O
stem O
cells, O
and O
immunomodulation O
are O
plausible O
underlying O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
early-life O
iAs O
exposure O
elicits O
latent O
carcinogenic O
effects. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Evidence O
is O
mounting O
that O
relates O
early-life O
iAs O
exposure O
and O
cancer O
development O
later O
in O
life. O
Future O
research O
should O
include O
animal O
studies O
that O
address O
mechanistic O
hypotheses O
and O
studies O
of O
human O
populations O
that O
integrate O
early-life O

outcomes. O

The O
antiarrhythmic O
activity O
of O
the O
compound O
N-(trans-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)-N-(3-oxo-3-phenyl-2-methylpropyl)-piperazine O
hydrochloride, O
referred O
to O
as O
P11, O
is O
studied O
on O
anaesthesized O
cats O
and O
Wistar O
albino O
rats, O
as O
well O
as O
on O
non-anaesthesized O
rabbits. O
Four O
types O
of O
experimental O
arrhythmia B
are O
used--with O
BaCl2, O
with O
chloroform-adrenaline, O
with O
strophantine O
G O
and O
with O
aconitine. O
The O
compound O
P11 O
is O
introduced O
in O
doses O
of O
0.25 O
and O
0.50 O
mg/kg O
intravenously O
and O
10 O
mg/kg O
orally. O
The O
compound O
manifests O
antiarrhythmic O
activity O
in O
all O
models O
of O
experimental O
arrhythmia O
used, O
causing O
greatest O
inhibition O
on O
the O
arrhythmia O
induced O
by O
chloroform-adrenaline O
(in O
90 O
per O
cent) O
and O
with O
BaCl2 O
(in O
84 O
per O
cent). O
The O
results O
obtained O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
beta-adrenoblocking O
and O
with O
the O
membrane-stabilizing O
action O
of O
the O
compound. O

Experimental O

We O
are O
still O
a O
long O
way O
from O
discovering O
an O
unequivocal O
pathogenetic O
interpretation O
of O
progressive O
muscular B
dystrophy I
in O
man. O
Noteworthy O
efforts O
have O
been O
made O
in O
the O
experimental O
field; O
a O
recessive O
autosomic O
form O
found O
in O
the O
mouse O
seems O
to O
bear O
the O
closest O
resemblance O
to O
the O
human O
form O
from O
the O
genetic O
point O
of O
view. O
Myopathy B
due O
to O
lack O
of O
vitamin O
E O
and O
myopathy B
induced O
by O
certain O
viruses O
have O
much O
in O
common O
anatomically O
and O
pathologically O
with O
the O
human O
form. O
The O
authors O
induced O
myodystrophy B
in O
the O
rat O
by O
giving O
it O
a O
diet O
lacking O
in O
vitamin O
E. O
The O
pharmacological O
characteristics O
of O
vitamin O
E O
and O
the O
degenerative O
changes O
brought O
about O
by O
its O
deficiency, O
especially O
in O
the O
muscles, O
are O
illustrated. O
It O
is O
thus O
confirmed O
that O
the O
histological O
characteristics O
of O
myopathic B
rat O
muscle O
induced O
experimentally O
are O
extraordinarily O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
human O
myopathy O
as O
confirmed O
during O
biopsies O
performed O
at O
the O
Orthopaedic O
Traumatological O
Centre, O
Florence. O
The O
encouraging O
results O
obtained O
in O
various O
authoratative O
departments O
in O
myopathic O
patients O
by O
using O
anabolizing O
steroids O
have O
encouraged O
the O
authors O
to O
investigate O
the O
beneficial O
effects O
of O
one O
anabolizing O
agent O
(Dianabol, O
CIBA) O
at O
high O
doses O
in O
rats O
rendered O
myopathic O
by O
a O
diet O
deficient O
in O
vitamin O
E. O
In O
this O
way O
they O
obtained O
appreciable O
changes O
in O
body O
weight O
(increased O
from O
50 O
to O
70 O
g O
after O
forty O
days O
at O
a O
dose O
of O
5 O
mg O
per O
day O
of O
anabolizing O
agent), O
but O
most O
of O
all O
they O
found O
histological O
changes O
due O
to O
"regenerative" O
changes O
in O
the O
muscle O
tissue, O
which O
however O
maintained O
its O
myopathic O
characteristics O
in O
the O
control O
animals O
that O
were O
not O
treated O
with O
the O
anabolizing O
agent. O
The O
authors O
conclude O
by O
affirming O
the O
undoubted O
efficacy O
of O
the O
anabolizing O
steroids O
in O
experimental O
myopathic B
disease, I
but O
they O
have O
reservations O
as O
to O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
results O
into O
the O
human O
field, O
where O
high O
dosage O
cannot O
be O
carried O
out O
continuously O
because O
of O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
on O
virility; O
because O
the O
tissue O
injury O
too O
often O
occurs O
at O
an O
irreversible O
stage O
vis-a-vis O
the O
"regeneration" O
of O
the O
muscle O
tissue; O
and O
finally O
because O
the O
dystrophic O
injurious O
agent O
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
lack O
of O
vitamin O
E O
but O
something O
as O
yet O
unknown. O

Two O

been O
reported O
in O
11 O

of O
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol O
(MHPG) O

were O
determined O
in O
17 O
healthy O

21 O
patients O
meeting O
DSM-III O
criteria O
for O
agoraphobia B

Caffeine O
produced O
significantly O
greater O
increases O
in O
subject-rated O
anxiety, B
nervousness, O
fear, O
nausea, B
palpitations, B
restlessness, B
and O

in O
the O

compared O
with O
healthy O

In O
the O
patients, O
but O
not O
the O
healthy O
subjects, O
these O
symptoms O
were O
significantly O
correlated O
with O
plasma O
caffeine O

Seventy-one O
percent O
of O
the O
patients O
reported O
that O
the O
behavioral O
effects O
of O
caffeine O
were O
similar O
to O
those O
experienced O
during O
panic O
attacks. O
Caffeine O
did O
not O
alter O
plasma O
MHPG O
levels O
in O
either O
the O

Caffeine O
increased O
plasma O
cortisol O
levels O
equally O
in O
the O

Because O
caffeine O
is O
an O
adenosine O

these O

suggest O
that O
some O

STUDY O
OBJECTIVE: O
Chest B

in O
the O

poses O
a O

dilemma. O
Dobutamine O
stress O
echocardiography O
(DSE) O
is O
a O
widely O
available O
and O
sensitive O
test O
for O
evaluating O

Because O
of O
the O
theoretical O
concern O
regarding O
administration O
of O
dobutamine O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
cocaine O
use, O
we O
conducted O
a O
pilot O
study O
to O
assess O
the O
safety O
of O
DSE O
in O
emergency O
department O
patients O
with O
cocaine-associated O
chest B
pain. I
METHODS: O
A O
prospective O
case O
series O
was O
conducted O
in O
the O
intensive O
diagnostic O
and O
treatment O
unit O
in O
the O
ED O
of O
an O
urban O
tertiary-care O
teaching O
hospital. O
Patients O
were O
eligible O
for O
DSE O
if O
they O
had O
used O
cocaine O
within O
24 O
hours O
preceding O
the O
onset O
of O
chest O
pain O
and O
had O
a O
normal O

level. O
Patients O
exhibiting O
signs O
of O
continuing O
cocaine O

were O
excluded O
from O
the O
study. O
All O
patients O
were O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
serial O
testing O
after O
the O
DSE O
testing O
in O
the O
intensive O
diagnostic O
and O
treatment O
unit. O
RESULTS: O
Twenty-four O
patients O
were O
enrolled. O
Two O
patients O
had O
inadequate O
resting O
images, O
one O
DSE O
was O
terminated O
because O
of O
inferior O
hypokinesis, B
another O
DSE O
was O
terminated O
because O
of O
a O
rate-related O
atrial O
conduction O
deficit, O
and O
1 O
patient O
did O
not O
reach O
the O
target O
heart O
rate. O
Thus, O
19 O
patients O
completed O
a O
DSE O
and O
reached O
their O
target O
heart O
rates. O
None O
of O
the O
patients O
experienced O
signs O
of O
exaggerated O

response, O
which O
was O
defined O
as O
a O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
of O
greater O
than O
200 O
mm O
Hg O
or O
the O
occurrence O
of O
tachydysrhythmias B
(excluding O
sinus B
tachycardia). I
Further O
suggesting O
lack O
of O
exaggerated O
adrenergic O
response, O
13 O
(65%) O
of O
20 O
patients O
required O
supplemental O
atropine O
to O
reach O
their O
target O
heart O
rates. O
CONCLUSION: O
No O
exaggerated O
adrenergic O
response O
was O
detected O
when O
dobutamine O
was O
administered O
to O
patients O
with O
cocaine-related O

It O
is O
well O

The O

during O
bladder O
irrigation, O
a O
vagal O
maneuver, O
in O
the O
context O
of O
amiodarone O

BACKGROUND: O
Patients O
with O
primary B
systemic I
amyloidosis I
(AL) O
have B
a O
poor O
prognosis. O
Median O
survival O
time O
from O
standard O

17 O
months. O
High-dose O
intravenous O
melphalan O
followed O
by O
peripheral O
blood O
stem O
cell O
transplant O
(PBSCT) O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
most O
promising O
therapy, O
but O
treatment O
mortality O
can O
be O
high. O
The O
authors O
have O
noted O
the O
development O
of O
acute B
renal I
insufficiency I
immediately O
after O
melphalan O

This O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
further O
examine O
its O

factors O
and O
impact O
on O
posttransplant O
mortality. O
METHODS: O
Consecutive O
AL O
patients O
who O
underwent O
PBSCT O
were O
studied O
retrospectively. O
Acute B
renal I
insufficiency I
(ARI) O
after B
high-dose O
melphalan O
was O
defined O
by O
a O
minimum O
increase O
of O
0.5 O
mg/dL O
(44 O
micromol/L) O
in O
the O
serum O
creatinine O
level O
that O
is O
greater O
than O
50% O
of O
baseline O
immediately O
after O

Urine O
sediment O
score O
was O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
individual O
types O
of O

identified O
on O
urine O
microscopy. O
RESULTS: O
Of O
the O
80 O
patients O
studied, O
ARI O
developed O
in O
18.8% O
of O
the O
patients O
after O
high-dose O
melphalan. O
Univariate O
analysis O
identified O
age, O
hypoalbuminemia, B
heavy O
proteinuria, B
diuretic O
use, O
and O
urine O
sediment O
score O
(>3) O
as O
risk O
factors. O
Age O
and O
urine O
sediment O
score O
remained O
independently O
significant O
risk O
factors O
in O
the O
multivariate O
analysis. O
Patients O
who O
had O
ARI O
after O
high-dose O
melphalan O
underwent O
dialysis O
more O
often O
(P O
= O
0.007), O
and O
had O
a O
worse O
1-year O
survival O
(P O
= O
0.03). O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
timing O
of O
renal B
injury I
strongly O
suggests O
melphalan O
as O
the O
causative O
agent. O
Ongoing O
tubular B
injury I
may O
be O
a O
prerequisite O
for O
renal O
injury O
by O
melphalan O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
active O
urinary O
sediment. O
Development O
of O
ARI O

RESULTS: O
There O
were O
no O

cocaine O
use. O

PURPOSE: O
We O
report O
4 O
cases O
of O
corneal B
ulcers I
associated O
with O
drug B
abuse. I
The O
pathogenesis O
of O
these O
ulcers O
and O
management O
of O
these O
patients O
are O
also O
reviewed. O
METHODS: O
Review O
of O
all O
cases O
of O
corneal O
ulcers O
associated O
with O
drug O
abuse O
seen O
at O
our O
institution O
from O
July O
2006 O
to O
December O
2006. O
RESULTS: O
Four O
patients O
with O
corneal O
ulcers O
associated O
with O
crack O
cocaine O
use O
were O
reviewed. O
All O
corneal O
ulcers O
were O
cultured, O
and O
the O
patients O
were O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
intensive O
topical O
antibiotic O
treatment. O
Each O
patient O
received O
comprehensive O
health O
care, O
including O
medical O
and O
substance B
abuse I
consultations. O
Streptococcal O
organisms O
were O
found O
in O
3 O
cases O
and O
Capnocytophaga O
and O
Brevibacterium O
casei O
in O
1 O
patient. O
The O
infections B
responded O
to O
antibiotic O
treatment. O
Two O
patients O
needed O
a O
lateral O
tarsorrhaphy O
for O
persistent O
epithelial B
defects. I
CONCLUSIONS: O
Aerosolized O
crack O
cocaine O
use O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
corneal O
ulcers. O
Drug B
abuse I
provides O
additional O
challenges O
for O
management. O
Not O
only O
treatment O
of O
their O
infections O
but O
also O
the O
overall O
poor O
health O
of O
the O
patients O
and O
increased O
risk O
of O
noncompliance O
need O
to O
be O
addressed. O
Comprehensive O
care O
may O
provide O
the O
patient O
the O
opportunity O
to O
discontinue O
their O
substance O
abuse, O
improve O
their O
overall O
health, O
and O
prevent O

of O
oral O
levetiracetam O
administered O
as O
an O
adjunct O
to O
phenobarbital O
treatment O
in O
cats O
with O

DESIGN-Open-label, O
noncomparative O
clinical O
trial. O
ANIMALS: O
12 O
cats O
suspected O
to O
have O
idiopathic O
epilepsy O
that O
was O
poorly O
controlled O
with O
phenobarbital O
or O
that O
had O
unacceptable O
adverse O
effects O
when O
treated O
with O
phenobarbital. O
PROCEDURES: O
Cats O
were O
treated O
with O
levetiracetam O
(20 O
mg/kg O
[9.1 O
mg/lb], O
PO, O
q O
8 O
h). O
After O
a O
minimum O
of O
1 O
week O
of O
treatment, O
serum O
levetiracetam O
concentrations O
were O
measured O
before O
and O
2, O
4, O
and O
6 O
hours O
after O
drug O
administration, O
and O
maximum O
and O
minimum O
serum O
concentrations O
and O
elimination O
half-life O
were O
calculated. O
Seizure B
frequencies O
before O
and O
after O
initiation O
of O
levetiracetam O
treatment O
were O
compared, O
and O
adverse O
effects O
were O
recorded. O
RESULTS: O
Median O
maximum O
serum O
levetiracetam O
concentration O
was O
25.5 O
microg/mL, O
median O
minimum O
serum O
levetiracetam O
concentration O
was O
8.3 O
microg/mL, O
and O
median O
elimination O
half-life O
was O
2.9 O
hours. O
Median O
seizure B
frequency O
prior O
to O
treatment O
with O
levetiracetam O
(2.1 O

was O
significantly O
higher O
than O
median O
seizure O
frequency O
after O
initiation O
of O
levetiracetam O
treatment O
(0.42 O

CONCLUSIONS O
AND O
CLINICAL O
RELEVANCE: O
Results O
suggested O
that O
levetiracetam O
is O
well O
tolerated O
in O
cats O

Bilateral O
haemorrhagic B
infarction B
of I
the I
globus I
pallidus I
after O
cocaine O
and O
alcohol O
intoxication. O

Cocaine O
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
both O
ischemic B
and I
haemorrhagic B
stroke. I
We O
present O
the O
case O
of O
a O
31-year-old O
man O
with O
bilateral O
ischemia B
of I
the I
globus I
pallidus I
after O
excessive O
alcohol O
and O
intranasal O
cocaine O
use. O
Drug-related O
globus B
pallidus I
infarctions I
are O
most O
often O
associated O
with O
heroin. O
Bilateral O
basal B
ganglia I
infarcts I
after O
the O
use O
of O
cocaine, O
without O
concurrent O
heroin O
use, O
have O
never O
been O
reported. O
In O
our O
patient, O
transient O
cardiac B
arrhythmia I
or O
respiratory B
dysfunction I
related O
to O
cocaine O
and/or O
ethanol O
use O
were O
the O
most O
likely O
causes O
of O
cerebral B
hypoperfusion. I

Acute B
renal I
failure I
after O
high-dose O
methotrexate O
therapy O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
ileostomy. O

High-dose O
methotrexate O
(HD-MTX) O
is O
an O
important O
treatment O
for O
Burkitt B
lymphoma, I
but O
can O
cause O
hepatic B
and I
renal B
toxicity I
when O
its O
clearance O
is O
delayed. O
We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
acute B
renal I
failure I
after O
HD-MTX O
therapy O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
ileostomy, O
The O
patient O
was O
a O
3-year-old O
boy O
who O
had O
received O
a O
living-related O
liver O
transplantation O
for O
congenital O
biliary B
atresia. I
At O
day O
833 O
after O
the O
transplantation, O
he O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
PTLD B
(post-transplantation O
lymphoproliferative B
disorder, I
Burkitt-type B
malignant I
lymphoma). I
During O
induction O
therapy, O
he O
suffered O
ileal O
perforation O
and O
ileostomy O
was O
performed. O
Subsequent O
HD-MTX O
therapy O
caused O
acute O
renal O
failure O
that O
required O
continuous O
hemodialysis. O
We O
supposed O
that O
intravascular O
hypovolemia B
due O
to O
substantial O
drainage O
from O
the O
ileostoma O
caused O
acute B
prerenal I
failure. I
After O
recovery O
of O
his O
renal O
function, O
we O
could O
safely O
treat O
the O
patient O
with O
HD-MTX O
therapy O
by O
controlling O
drainage O
from O
ileostoma O
with O
total O
parenteral O
nutrition. O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
PURPOSE: O
Cerebral B
microbleeds I
(MB) O
are B
potential O
risk O
factors O
for O
intracerebral B
hemorrhage I
(ICH), O
but B
it O
is O
unclear O
if O
they O
are O
a O
contraindication O
to O
using O
antithrombotic O
drugs. O
Insights O
could O
be O
gained O
by O
pooling O

stratified O
by O
antithrombotic O
use O
in O
cohorts O
with O
ICH O
and O
ischemic B

METHODS: B
We O
performed O
a O
systematic O

unpublished O
data O
from O

to O
compare O
the O

of O
MB O
in: O
(1) O
antithrombotic O

with O
ICH; O
(2) O

with O
IS/TIA; O
and O
(3) O
ICH O
vs O
ischemic O

stratified O
by O
antithrombotic O
use. O
We O
also O
analyzed O

unpublished O
follow-up O
data O
to O
determine O
the O
risk O
of O
ICH O
in O
antithrombotic O

RESULTS: O
In O
a O
pooled O
analysis O
of O
1460 O
ICH O
and O
3817 O
IS/TIA, O
MB O
were O
more O
frequent O
in O
ICH O
vs O
IS/TIA O
in O
all O

but O
the O

increased O
from O
2.8 O
(odds O

2.3-3.5) O
in O
nonantithrombotic O

to O
5.7 O
(range, O

and O
8.0 O
(range, O
3.5-17.8) O
in O

ICH O
(OR, O
1.7; O
95% O

In O
pooled O
follow-up O
data O
for O
768 O
antithrombotic O

of O
subsequent O
ICH O
(OR, O
12.1; O
95% O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
excess O
of O
MB O
in O
warfarin O
users O
with O
ICH O
compared O
to O
other O
groups O
suggests O
that O

AIM: O
Verapamil O
stimulation O
test O
was O
previously O
investigated O
as O
a O
tool O
for O
differential O
diagnosis O
of O
hyperprolactinemia, B
but O
with O
conflicting O
results. O
Macroprolactinemia B
was O
never O
considered O
in O
those O
previous O
studies. O
Here, O
we O
aimed O
to O
re-investigate O
the O
diagnostic O
value O
of O
verapamil O
in O
a O
population O
who O
were O
all O
screened O
for O
macroprolactinemia. B
Prolactin O

verapamil O
in O
65 O
female O
patients O
(age: O
29.9 O
+/- O
8.1 O
years) O
with O
hyperprolactinemia O
were O
tested O
in O
a O
descriptive, O
matched O
case-control O
study. O
METHODS: O
Verapamil O
80 O
mg, O
p.o. O
was O
administered, O
and O
then O
PRL O
levels O
were O
measured O
at O
8th O
and O
16th O
hours, O
by O
immunometric O
chemiluminescence. O
Verapamil O
responsiveness O
was O
determined O
by O
peak O
percent O
change O
in O
basal O
prolactin O
levels O
(PRL). O
RESULTS: O
Verapamil O
significantly O
increased O
PRL O
levels O
in O
healthy O
controls O
(N. O
8, O
PRL: O
183%), O
macroprolactinoma B
(N. O
8, O

PRL: O
126%), O
but O
not O
in O
pseudoprolactinoma B
(N. O
8, O
PRL: O
0.8%), O
and O
risperidone-induced O
hyperprolactinemia O
(N. O
7, O
PRL: O
3%). O
ROC O
curve O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
unresponsiveness O
to O
verapamil O
defined O
as O
PRL O
<7%, O
discriminated O
anatomical O
or O
functional O
stalk O
effect O
(sensitivity: O
74%, O
specificity: O
73%, O
AUC: O
0.855+/-0.04, O
P O

CI: O
0.768-0.942) O
associated O
with O
pseudoprolactinoma O
or O
risperidone-induced O
hyperprolactinemia, O
respectively. O
CONCLUSION: O
Verapamil O
responsiveness O
is O
not O
a O
reliable O
finding O
for O
the O
differential O
diagnosis O
of O
hyperprolactinemia. O
However, O
verapamil O
unresponsiveness O
discriminates O
stalk O
effect O
(i.e., O
anatomically O
or O
functionally O
inhibited O
dopaminergic O
tonus) O
from O
other O
causes O
of O
hyperprolactinemia O
with O
varying O
degrees O
of O
responsiveness. O

The O
effect O
of O
clonidine, O
naphazoline O
and O
xylometazoline O
on O
analgesia O
induced O
by O
morphine, O
codeine, O
fentanyl O
and O
pentazocine, O
and O
on O
cataleptic B
effect O
of O
morphine, O
codine O
and O
fentanyl O
was O
studied O
in O
rats. O
The O
biochemical O
assays O
on O
the O
influence O
of O
four O
analgesics O
on O
the O
brain O
concentration O
and O
turnover O
of O
noradrenaline O
(NA) O
were O
also O
performed. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
three O
drugs O
stimulating O
central O
NA O
receptors O
failed O
to O
affect O
the O
analgesic O
ED50 O
of O
all O
antinociceptive O
agents O
and O
they O
enhanced O
catalepsy B
induced O
by O
morphine O
and O
fentanyl. O
Codeine O
catalepsy O
was O
increased O
by O
clonidine O
and O
decreased O
by O
naphazoline O
and O
xylometazoline. O
The O
brain O
concentration O
of O
NA O
was O
not O
changed O
by O
morphine O
and O
fentanyl, O
but O
one O
of O
the O
doses O
of O
codeine O
(45 O
mg/kg) O
slightly O
enhanced O
it. O
Pentazocine O
dose-dependently O
decreased O
the O
brain O
level O
of O
NA. O
The O
rate O
of O
NA O
turnover O
was O
not O
altered O
by O
analgesics O
except O
for O
the O
higher O
dose O
of O
fentanyl O
(0.2 O
mg/kg) O
following O
which O
the O
disappearance O
of O
NA O
from O
the O
brain O
was O
diminished. O
The O
results O
are O
discussed O
in O
the O
light O
of O
various O
and O
non-uniform O
data O
from O
the O
literature. O
It O
is O
suggested O
that O
in O
rats O
the O
brain O
NA O
plays O
a O
less O
important O
function O
than O
the O
other O
monoamines O
in O
the O
behavioural O
activity O
of O
potent O
analgesics. O

Modification O
by O

hypoglycaemia. B

The O
cardiovascular O
effects O
of O
hypoglycaemia, B
with O
and O
without O
beta-blockade, O
were O
compared O
in O
fourteen O
healthy O
men. O
Eight O
received O
insulin O
alone, O
and O
eight, O
including O
two O
of O
the O
original O
insulin-only O
group, O
were O
given O
propranolol O
and O
insulin. O
In O
the O
insulin-group O
the O
period O
of O
hypoglycaemia O
was O
associated O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
heart-rate O
and O
a O
fall O
in O
diastolic O
blood-pressure. O
In O
the O
propranolol-insulin O
group O
there O
was O
a O
significant O
fall O
in O
heart-rate O
in O
most O
subjects O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
diastolic O
pressure. O
Typical O
S-T/T O
changes O
occurred O
in O
the O
insulin-group O
but O
in O
none O
of O
the O
propranolol-insulin O
group. O
Hypertension B

prone O
to O
hypoglycaemia O
attacks O
should O
not O
be O
treated O

A O
patient O
taking O
diphenylhydantoin O
for O
3 O
weeks O
developed O
a O
generalized O
skin B
rash, I
lymphadenopathy B
and O
pure B
red I

aplasia. I
After O
withdrawal O
of O
the O

disappeared O
spontaneously. O
Skin B
rash I
is O
a O
well-known O
complication O
of O
diphenylhydantoin O
treatment O
as O
is O
benign O
and O
malignant O
lymphadenopathy. O
Pure B
red I
cell I

associated O
with O
diphenylhydantoin O

has O
been O
reported O
in O
3 O
patients. O
The O
exact O
mechanism O
by O
which O
diphenylhydantoin O
exerts O
its O
toxic O

is O
not O
known. O
In O
this O

and O
the O
occurrence O
of O
the O

patients. O

The O
cure O
rate O
of O
infections B
in O
cancer B
patients O
is O
adversely O
affected O
by O
neutropenia B
(less O
than O
1,000/mm3). O
In O
particular, O
patients O
with O
severe O
neutropenia O
(less O
than O
100/mm3) O
have O
shown O
a O
poor O
response O
to O
antibiotics. O
To O
overcome O
the O
adverse O
effects O
of O
neutropenia, O
tobramycin O
was O
given O
by O
continuous O
infusion O
and O
combined O
with O
intermittent O
carbenicillin. O
Tobramycin O
was O
given O
to O
a O
total O
daily O
dose O
of O
300 O
mg/m2 O
and O
carbenicillin O
was O
given O
at O
a O
dose O
of O
5 O
gm O
every O
four O
hours. O
There O
were O
125 O
infectious O
episodes O
in O
116 O
cancer O
patients O
receiving O
myelosuppressive O
chemotherapy. O
The O
overall O
cure O
rate O
was O
70%. O
Pneumonia B
was O
the O
most O
common O
infection O
and O
61% O
of O
59 O
episodes O
were O
cured. O
Gram-negative O
bacilli O
were O
the O
most O
common O
causative O
organisms O
and O
69% O
of O
these O
infections O
were O
cured. O
The O
most O
common O
pathogen O
was O
Klebsiella O
pneumoniae B
and O
this, O
together O
with O
Escherichia O
coli O
and O
Pseudomonas O
aeruginosa, O
accounted O
for O
74% O
of O
all O
gram-negative B
bacillary I
infections. I
Response O
was O
not O
influenced O
by O
the O
initial O
neutrophil O
count, O
with O
a O
62% O
cure O
rate O
for O
39 O
episodes O
associated O
with O
severe O
neutropenia. O
However, O
failure O
of O
the O
neutrophil O
count O
to O
increase O
during O
therapy O
adversely O
affected O
response. O
Azotemia B
was O
the O
major O
side O
effect O
recognized, O
and O
it O
occurred O
in O
11% O
of O
episodes. O
Major O
azotemia B
(serum O
creatinine O
greater O
than O
2.5 O
mg/dl O
or O
BUN O
greater O
than O
50 O
mg/dl) O
occurred O
in O
only O
2%. O
Azotemia O
was O
not O
related O
to O
duration O
of O
therapy O
or O
serum O
tobramycin O
concentration. O
This O
antibiotic O
regimen O
showed O
both O
therapeutic O
efficacy O
and O
acceptable O
renal B
toxicity I
for O
these O
patients. O

Recurrent O
subarachnoid B

Case O
report. O

Epsilon O
aminocaproic O
acid O
(EACA) O
has O
been O
used O
to O
prevent O
rebleeding O
in O
patients O
with O
subarachnoid B
hemorrhage I
(SAH). O
Although B
this O
agent O
does O
decrease O
the O
frequency O
of O
rebleeding, O
several O
reports O
have O
described O
thrombotic B
complications O
of O
EACA O
therapy. O
These O
complications O
have O
included O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
intracranial B
vascular I

and O
capillary O
fibrin O
thrombi B
in O
patients O
with O
fibrinolytic O
syndromes O
treated O
with O
EACA, O
or O
other O
thromboembolic B
phenomena. I
Since O
intravascular O
fibrin O
thrombi O
are O
often O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
fibrinolytic O
disorders, O
EACA O
should O
not O
be O
implicated O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
fibrin O
thrombi O
in O
patients O
with O
disseminated B
intravascular I
coagulation I
or O
other O
"consumption O

This I
report O
describes O
subtotal O
infarction B
of O
the O
kidney O
due O
to O
thrombosis B
of I
a I
normal I
renal I
artery. I
This O
occlusion O
occurred O
after O
EACA O
therapy O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
SAH O
and O
histopathological O
documentation O
of O
recurrent O
SAH. O
The O
corresponding O
clinical O
event O
was O
characterized O
by O
marked O
hypertension B
and O
abrupt O

deterioration. O

Propranolol, O
a O
beta-adrenergic O
blocking O
agent, O
has O
found O
an O
important O
position O
in O
the O
practice O
of O
medicine. O
Its O
use O
in O
pregnancy, O
however, O
is O
an O
open O
question O
as O
a O
number O
of O
detrimental O
side O
effects O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
fetus O
and O
neonate. O
Ten O
patients O
and O
12 O
pregnancies O
are O
reported O
where O
chronic O
propranolol O
has O
been O
administered. O
Five O
patients O
with O
serial O
pregnancies O
with O
and O
without O
propranolol O
therapy O
are O
also O
examined. O
Maternal, O
fetal, O
and O
neonatal O
complications O
are O
examined. O
An O
attempt O
is O
made O
to O
differentiate O
drug-related O
complications O
from O
maternal O
disease--related O
complications. O
We O
conclude O
that O
previously O
reported O
hypoglycemia, B
hyperbilirubinemia, B
polycythemia, B
neonatal B
apnea, I
and O
bradycardia B
are O
not O
invariable O
and O
cannot O
be O
statistically O
correlated O
with O
chronic O
propranolol O
therapy. O
Growth B
retardation, I
however, O
appears O
to O
be O
significant O
in O
both O
of O
our O
series. O

Use O

who O
had O
physiologic O
and O
biochemical O
evidence O
of O
severe O

They O
all O

markedly O
reduced O

plasma O
renin O

in O
both O
recumbent O

and O
had O
marked O
hypersensitivity B
to O
the O

norepinephrine. O
Treatment O
with O
propanolol O

intravenously O
(1-5 O

4 O
of O
the O
5 O
individuals O
with O

ranging O
from O
11/6 O
to O
22/11 O
mmHg. O
Chronic O
oral O
administration O
of O
propranolol O
(40-160 O
mg/day) O
also O
elevated O
the O
blood O

of O
these O
individuals O
with O
increases O
in O
the O
order O
of O
20-35/15-25 O
mmg O
being O
observed. O
In O
1 O
patient, O
marked O
hypertension B
was O
induced O
by O
propranolol O
and O
the O
drug O
had O
to O
be O
withdrawn. O
It O
otherwise O
was O
well O
tolerated O
and O
no O
important O
side O
effects O
were O
observed. O
Treatment O
has O
been O
continued O
in O
3 O
individuals O
for O
6-13 O
months O
with O
persistence O

although O
there O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
some O
decrease O
in O
the O
degree O

with O
time. O
Hemodynamic O
measurements O
in O
1 O
of O
the O
patients O
demonstrated O
an O
increase O
in O
total O
peripheral O
resistance O
and O
essentially O
no O
change O
in O
cardiac O
output O
following O
propranolol O
therapy. O
The O
studies O
suggest O
that O
propranolol O
is O
a O
useful O
drug O
in O
selected O
patients O
with O
severe O
idiopathic O
orthostatic O

An O
investigation O
was O
undertaken O
to O
determine O
the O
dosage O
of O
etomidate O
required O
to O
maintain O
sleep O
in O
adults O
undergoing O
surgery O
under O
regional O
local O
anesthesia. O
Premedication O
of O
diazepam O
10 O
mg O
and O
atropine O
0.5 O
mg O
was O
given, O
and O
sleep O
was O
induced O
and O
maintained O
by O
intermittent O
intravenous O
injections O
of O
etomidate O
0.1/mg/kg, O
given O
whenever O
the O
patient O
would O
open O
his O
eyes O
on O
request. O
A O
mean O
overall O
dose O
of O
etomidate O
17.4 O
microgram/kg/min. O
was O
required O
to O
maintain O
sleep, O
but O
great O
individual O
variation O
occurred, O
with O
older O
patients O
requiring O
less O
drug. O
The O
investigation O
was O
discontinued O
after O
18 O
patients O
because O
of O
the O
frequency O
and O
intensity O
of O
side-effects, O
particularly O
pain B
and O
myoclonia, B
which O
caused O
the O
technique O
to O
be O
abandoned O
in O
two O
cases. O
It O
is O
considered O
unlikely O
that O
etomidate O
will O
prove O
to O
be O
the O
hypnotic O
of O
choice O
for O
a O
totally O
intravenous O
anesthetic O
technique O
in O
adults O
because O
of O
the O
high O
incidence O
of O
myoclonia O
after O
prolonged O
administration. O
In O
several O
patients O
uncontrollable O
muscle O

for O
the O
measurement O
of O
tremor, B

A O
method O
permitting O
measurement O
of O
finger O
tremor B
as O
a O
displacement-time O
curve O
is O
described, O
using O
a O
test O
system O
with O
simple O

The O
coordinates O
of O
the O
inversion O
points O
of O
the O
displacement-time O
curves O
were O
transferred O
through O
graphical O
input O
equipment O
to O
punched O
tape. O
By O
means O
of O
a O
computer O
program, O
periods O
and O
amplitudes O
of O
tremor O
oscillations O
were O
calculated O
and O
classified. O
The O
event O
frequency O
for O
each O
class O
of O
periods O
and O
amplitudes O
was O
determined. O
The O
actions O
of O
fenoterol-hydrobromide, O
ritodrin-HCl O
and O
placebo O
given O
to O
10 O
healthy O
subjects O
by O
intravenous O
infusion O
in O
a O
double-blind O
crossover O
study O
were O
tested O
by O
this O
method. O
At O
therapeutic O
doses O
both O
substances O
raised O
the O
mean O
tremor O
amplitude O
to O
about O
three O
times O
the O
control O
level. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
mean O
period O
within O
each O
class O
of O
amplitudes O
shortened O
by O
10--20 O
ms, O
whereas O
the O
mean O
periods O
calculated O
from O
all O
oscillations O
together O
did O
not O
change O
significantly. O
After O
the O
end O
of O
fenoterol-hydrobromide O
infusion, O
tremor O
amplitudes O
decreased O
significantly O
faster O
than O
those O
following O

The O
influence O
of O
L-dopa O
on O
the O

was O
studied O
in O
3 O
patients O
with O

in O
5 O
normokalemic O
patients O
by O
determination O
of O
renal O

and O
sodium O
as O
well O
as O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
potassium, O
sodium O
and O
aldosterone. O
L-Dopa O
intake O
was O
found O
to O
cause O
an O
increased O
excretion O
of O
potassium, O
and O
sometimes O
also O
of O
sodium, O
in O
the O
hypokalemic O
but O
not O
in O
the O
normokalemic O
patients. O
This O
effect O
on O
the O
renal O
function O
could O
be O
prohibited O
by O
the O
administration O

It O
is O
not O
known O
why O
this O

not O
in O

Phenytoin O
encephalopathy B

A O
case O
of O
phenytoin O
(DPH) O
encephalopathy B
with O
increasing O
seizures B
and O
EEG O
and O
mental O

is O
described. O
Despite O
adequate O
oral O
dosage O
of O
DPH O
(5 O
mg/kg/daily) O
the O
plasma O
level O
was O
very O
low O
(2.8 O
microgramg/ml). O
The O
encephalopathy O
was O
probably O
an O
idiosyncratic O
and O
not O
toxic O
or O
allergic O
reaction. O
In O
fact O
the O
concentration O
of O
free O
DPH O
was O
normal, O
the O
patient O
presented O
a O
retarded O
morbilliform O
rash B
during O
DPH O
treatment, O
the O
protidogram O
was O
normal, O
and O
an O
intradermic O
DPH O
injection O
had O
no O
local O
effect. O
The O
authors O
conclude O
that O
in O
a O
patient O
starting O
DPH O
treatment O
an O
unexpected O
increase O
in O
seizures, O
with O
EEG O
and O
mental O

occurring O
simultaneously, O
should O
alert O
the O
physician O
to O
the O

determined. O
After O
determining O
the O

AD50 O
(the O
concentration O
of O
bupivacaine O
that O
caused O
50% O
of O
all O

arrhythmic), B
we O
determined O
the O
effect O
of O
1-hour O

HCl O
exposure O
on O
myocyte O
contractile O
rhythm. O
Each O
concentration O
of O
progesterone O
(6.25, O
12.5, O
25, O
and O
50 O
micrograms/ml) O
caused O
a O
significant O
and O
concentration-dependent O
reduction O
in O
the O
AD50 O
for O
bupivacaine. O
Estradiol O
treatment O
also O
increased O
the O
arrhythmogenicity O
of O
bupivacaine O
in O
myocyte O
cultures, O
but O
was O
only O
one O
fourth O
as O
potent O
as O
progesterone. O
Neither O
progesterone O
nor O
estradiol O
effects O
on O
bupivacaine O
arrhythmogenicity O
were O
potentiated O
by O
epinephrine. O
Chronic O
progesterone O
pretreatment O
(5 O
mg/kg/day O
for O
21 O
days) O
caused O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
bupivacaine O
arrhythmogenicity O
in O
intact O
pentobarbital-anesthetized O
rats. O
There O
was O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
the O
time O

onset O
of O
arrhythmia B
as O
compared O
with O
control O
nonprogesterone-treated O
rats O
(6.2 O
+/- O
1.3 O
vs. O
30.8 O
+/- O
2.5 O
min, O
mean O
+/- O
SE). O
The O
results O
of O
this O
study O
indicate O
that O
progesterone O
can O
potentiate O
bupivacaine O
arrhythmogenicity O
both O
in O
vivo O
and O
in O

Potentiation O
of O
bupivacaine O
arrhythmia O
in O

suggests O
that O
this O

is O
at O

level. O

Acute B
renal I

A O
patient O
with O

was O
undergoing O
home O
intravenous O
desferrioxamine O
(DFX) O
treatment O
by O
means O
of O
a O
totally O
implanted O
system O
because O
of O
his O
poor O
compliance O
with O
the O
nightly O
subcutaneous O
therapy. O
Due O
to O
an O
accidental O
malfunctioning O
of O
the O
infusion O
pump, O
the O
patient O
was O
inadvertently O
administered O
a O
toxic O
dosage O
of O
the O
drug O
which O
caused O
renal B
insufficiency. I
Given O
the O
progressive O
deterioration O
of O
the O
symptoms O
and O
of O
the O
laboratory O
values, O
despite O
adequate O
medical O
treatment, O
a O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
introduce O
haemodialytical O
therapy O
in O
order O
to O
remove O
the O
drug O
and O

reduce O
the O

From O
the O
results O
obtained, O
haemodialysis O
can O
therefore O
be O
suggested O
as O
a O
useful O
therapy O
in O
rare O
cases O
of O
progressive O
acute B

caused O
by O
desferrioxamine. O

Neuroleptic-associated O
hyperprolactinemia. B
Can O
it O
be O
treated O
with O
bromocriptine? O

Six O
stable O
psychiatric O
outpatients O
with O
hyperprolactinemia B
and O
amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea B
associated B
with O
their O
neuroleptic O
medications O
were O
treated O
with O
bromocriptine. O
Daily O
dosages O
of O
5-10 O
mg O
corrected O
the O
hyperprolactinemia O
and O
restored O
menstruation O
in O
four O
of O
the O
six O
patients. O
One O
woman, O
however, O
developed O
worsened O
psychiatric B
symptoms I
while O
taking O
bromocriptine, O
and O
it O
was O
discontinued. O
Thus, O
three O
of O
six O
patients O
had O
their O
menstrual O
irregularity O
successfully O
corrected O
with O
bromocriptine. O
This O
suggests O
that O
bromocriptine O
should O
be O
further O
evaluated O
as O
potential O
therapy O
for O
neuroleptic-associated O
hyperprolactinemia O
and O
amenorrhea/galactorrhea. O

Ethacrynic O

Intracerebroventricular O
injection O
of O
ethacrynic O

dose; O
50 O
micrograms/mouse) O
accelerated O
the O

(5-HT) O
but O
suppressed O
the O
synthesis O
of O
gamma-aminobutyric O

acetylcholine O
in O

These O
effects O
were O
completely O
antagonized O
by O
pretreatment O
with O
a O
glutamate/N-methyl-D-aspartate O
antagonist, O
aminophosphonovaleric O
acid. O
In O
ethacrynic O
acid-induced O
convulsions, B
these O
neurotransmitter O
systems O
may O
be O
differentially O
modulated, O
probably O
through O
activation O
of O
glutaminergic O

in O
the O

In O

the O

of O
the O
beta-carboline O

(abecarrnil), O
a O
new O
ligand O
for O
benzodiazepine O
receptors O
possessing O
anxiolytic O

was O
evaluated O
on O
the O
function O
of O
central O
gamma-aminobutyric O

complex, O
both O
in O

Added O

36Cl- O
uptake O
and O
reduced O
the O
binding O
of O
t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate O
([35S]TBPS). O
These O

After O

Moreover, O
both O

as O

as O
the O

To O
better O
correlate O
the O

we O
studied O
the O

and O
on O
isoniazid-induced O
biochemical O

In O
these O

Neither O

Pharmacodynamics O
of O
the O
hypotensive B
effect O
of O
levodopa O
in O
parkinsonian B
patients. O

Blood O
pressure O
effects O
of O
i.v. O
levodopa O
were O
examined O
in O
parkinsonian B
patients O
with O
stable O
and O
fluctuating O
responses O
to O
levodopa. O
The O
magnitude O
of O
the O
hypotensive B
effect O
of O
levodopa O
was O
concentration O
dependent O
and O
was O
fit O
to O
an O
Emax O
model O
in O
fluctuating O
responders. O
Stable O
responders O
demonstrated O
a O
small O
hypotensive O
response. O
Baseline O
blood O
pressures O
were O
higher O
in O
fluctuating O
patients; O
a O
higher O
baseline O
blood O
pressure O
correlated O
with O
greater O
hypotensive O
effects. O
Antiparkinsonian O
effects O
of O
levodopa O
temporally O
correlated O
with O
blood O
pressure O
changes. O
Phenylalanine, O
a O
large O
neutral O
amino O
acid O
(LNAA) O
competing O
with O
levodopa O
for O
transport O
across O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier, O
reduced O
the O
hypotensive O
and O
antiparkinsonian O
effects O
of O
levodopa. O
We O
conclude O
that O
levodopa O
has O
a O
central O
hypotensive O
action O
that O
parallels O
the O
motor O
effects O
in O
fluctuating O
patients. O
The O
hypotensive O
effect O
appears O
to O
be O
related O
to O
the O
higher O
baseline O

we O
observed O
in O

the O

In O

For O

the O
situation O
is O

Digoxin O
has O
a O
narrow O

affected O
by O
a O

Also, O
digoxin O

More O

Furthermore, O
no O

and O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
digoxin O
may O
increase O
mortality O
after O
myocardial B

(MI). O
Angiotensin-converting B

(ACE) O
inhibitors O
should O
be O
used O
first O
as O
they O
are O
safer, O
do O
not O
require O

modify O

relieve O

and O
reduce O

Caution O
should O
be O
exercised O
in O
using O
digoxin O
until O
large O
mortality O
trials O
are O
completed O
showing O
either O

The O

One O

The O

exacerbation O
with O
the O
serotonin O

fluoxetine O

are O
reported O
here. O
Elements O
common O
to O
these O
cases O
included O
a O
history O
of O
paranoid O
symptomatology O
and O
the O
concomitant O
occurrence O
of O
depressive B

psychotic B
symptoms. I
Complicated O

chronicity, O
psychosis, B

may O
present O
particular O
vulnerability O

with O

Although O
the O

remain O
cryptic, O
several O
mechanisms, O
including O
5HT3 O
receptor-mediated O
dopamine O

beta-noradrenergic O

downregulation, O
or O
GABAB O

(possibly O
in O

might O
apply O
to O

These O
cases O
call O

possible O
paranoid O

Five O
cases O

Five O
cases O
of O

following O
treatment O
with O
diethylcarbamazine O
(DEC) O
were O
observed O
in O
Congolese O
patients O

Two O
cases O
had O
a O
fatal O
outcome O
and O
one O
resulted O
in O
severe O

The O
notable O
fact O
was O
that O
this O
complication O
occurred O
in O
three O
patients O
hospitalized O
before O
treatment O
began, O
with O
whom O
particularly O
strict O
therapeutic O
precautions O
were O
taken, O
i.e., O
initial O
dose O
less O
than O
10 O
mg O
of O
DEC, O
very O
gradual O
dose O
increases, O
and O
associated O
anti-allergic O
treatment. O
This O
type O
of O
drug-induced O
complication O
may O
not O
be O
that O
uncommon O
in O
highly O
endemic O
regions. O
It O
occurs O
primarily, O
but O
not O
exclusively, O
in O
subjects O
presenting O
with O
a O
high O
microfilarial O
load. O
The O
relationship O
between O
the O
occurrence O
of O
encephalitis O
and O
the O
decrease O
in O
microfilaremia B
is O
evident. O
The O
pathophysiological O
mechanisms O
are O
discussed O
in O
the O

of O
these O
observations O

the O
few O

Delirium B
in O
an O
elderly O
woman O
possibly O
associated O
with O
administration O
of O
misoprostol. O

Misoprostol O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
adverse O
reactions, O
including O
gastrointestinal O
symptoms, O
gynecologic O
problems, O
and O
headache. B
Changes O
in O
mental O
status, O
however, O
have O
not O
been O
reported. O
We O
present O
a O
case O
in O
which O
an O
89-year-old O
woman O
in O
a O
long-term O
care O
facility O
became O
confused O
after O
the O
initiation O
of O
misoprostol O
therapy. O
The O
patient's O
change O
in O
mental O
status O
was O
first O
reported O
nine O
days O
after O
the O
initiation O
of O
therapy. O
Her O
delirium B
significantly O
improved O
after O
misoprostol O
was O
discontinued O
and O
her O
mental O
status O
returned O
to O
normal O
within O
a O
week. O
Because O
no O
other O
factors O
related O
to O
this O
patient O
changed O
significantly, O
the O
delirium O
experienced O
by O
this O
patient O
possibly O
resulted O
from O
misoprostol O
therapy. O

The O
pathophysiology O
underlying O
this O
acute O
hepatic B
injury I
is O
unknown. O
This O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
determine O
whether O
oxidants O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
hepatic O
injury O
and O
to O
determine O
the O
relative O
value O
of O
several O
indirect O
methods O
of O
assessing O
oxidant O
exposure O
in O
vivo. O
Rats O
were O
subjected O
to O
a O
standardized O
intestinal O
ischemia-reperfusion B
injury. B
Hepatic I
tissue O
was O
assayed O
for O
lipid O
peroxidation O
products O
and O
oxidized O
and O
reduced O
glutathione. O
There O
was O
no O
change O
in O
hepatic O
tissue O
total O
glutathione O
following O
intestinal O
ischemia-reperfusion O
injury. O
Oxidized O
glutathione O
(GSSG) O
increased O
significantly O
following O
30 O
and O
60 O
min O
of O
reperfusion. O
There O
was O
no O
increase O
in O
any O
of O
the O
products O
of O
lipid O
peroxidation O
associated O
with O
this O
injury. O
An O
increase O
in O
GSSG O
within O
hepatic O
tissue O
during O
intestinal O
reperfusion O
suggests O
exposure O
of O
hepatocytes O
to O
an O
oxidant O
stress. O
The O
lack O
of O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
products O
of O
lipid O
peroxidation O
suggests O
that O
the O
oxidant O
stress O
is O
of O
insufficient O
magnitude O
to O
result O
in O
irreversible O
injury O
to O
hepatocyte O
cell O
membranes. O
These O
data O
also O
suggest O
that O
the O
measurement O
of O
tissue O
GSSG O
may O
be O
a O
more O
sensitive O
indicator O
of O
oxidant O
stress O
than O
measurement O
of O
products O
of O
lipid O
peroxidation. O

Cimetidine, O
a O
histamine O
2 O
(H2) O
antagonist, O
produces O
a O
decrease O
in O
arterial O
pressure O
due O
to O
vasodilatation, O
especially O
in O
critically O
ill O
patients. O
This O
may O
be O
because O
cimetidine O
acts O
as O
a O
histamine O
agonist. O
We, O
therefore, O
investigated O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
histamine O
1(H1) O
receptor O
antagonist, O
diphenhydramine, O
on O
the O
haemodynamic O
changes O
observed O
after O
cimetidine O
in O
ICU O
patients. O
Each O
patient O
was O
studied O
on O
two O
separate O
days. O
In O
a O
random O
fashion, O
they O
received O
cimetidine O
200 O
mg O
iv O
on O
one O
day, O
and O
on O
the O
other, O
a O
pretreatment O
of O
diphenhydramine O
40 O
mg O
iv O
with O
cimetidine O
200 O
mg O
iv. O
In O
the O
non-pretreatment O
group, O
mean O
arterial O
pressure O
(MAP) O
decreased O
from O
107.4 O
+/- O
8.4 O
mmHg O
to O
86.7 O
+/- O
11.4 O
mmHg O
(P O
less O
than O
0.01) O
two O
minutes O
after O
cimetidine. O
Also, O
systemic O
vascular O
resistance O
(SVR) O
decreased O
during O
the O
eight-minute O
observation O
period O
(P O
less O
than O
0.01). O
In O
contrast, O
in O
the O
pretreatment O
group, O
little O
haemodynamic O
change O
was O
seen. O
We O
conclude O
that O
an O
H1 O
antagonist O
may O
be O
useful O
in O
preventing O
hypotension B
caused O
by O
iv O
cimetidine, O
since O
the O
vasodilating O
activity O
of O
cimetidine O
is O
mediated, O
in O
part, O
through O
the O
H1 O
receptor. O

Acute B
renal I
failure I
due O
to O
rifampicin. O

A O
23-year-old O
male O
patient O
with O
bacteriologically O
proven O
pulmonary B
tuberculosis I
was O
treated O
with O
the O
various O
regimens O
of O
antituberculosis O
drugs O
for O
nearly O
15 O
months. O
Rifampicin O
was O
administered O
thrice O
as O
one O
of O
the O
3-4 O
drug O
regimen O
and O
each O
time O
he O
developed O
untoward O
side O
effects O
like O
nausea, B
vomiting B
and O
fever B
with O
chills O
and O
rigors. O
The O
last O
such O

at O
which O
stage O
the O

by O
the O

Two O

severe O
delayed O

related O
to O
the O
administration O
of O
intrathecal O
(IT) O
combination O

including O
thiotepa O
(TSPA) O
are O
presented. O
Both O
cases O
developed O
axonal B

with O
motor O
predominance O
in O
the O
lower O

1 O
and O
6 O
months O
after O
IT O

was O
administered. O
Neurologic B
toxicities I
have O
been O
described O
with O
IT-methotrexate, O
IT-cytosine O
arabinoside O
and O
IT-TSPA. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
however, O
axonal O
neuropathy O
following O
administration O
of O
these O
three O
agents O
has O
not O
been O
previously O
described. O
In O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
TSPA O
is O
a O
useful O
IT O
agent, O
its O
combination O
with O
MTX, O
ara-C O
and O
radiotherapy O
could O
cause O
severe O
neurotoxicity. B
This O
unexpected O
complication O
indicates O
the O
need O
for O
further O
toxicology O

on O
IT-TSPA. O

The O
effects O
of O
i.v. O
bolus O
administration O
of O
cromakalim O
(1-10 O
micrograms/kg) O
and O
pinacidil O
(3-100 O
micrograms/kg) O
on O
large O
(circumflex O
artery) O
and O
small O
coronary O
arteries O
and O
on O
systemic O
hemodynamics O
were O
investigated O
in O
chronically O
instrumented O
conscious O
dogs O
and O
compared O
to O
those O
of O
nitroglycerin O
(0.03-10 O
micrograms/kg). O
Nitroglycerin, O
up O
to O
0.3 O
micrograms/kg, O
selectively O
increased O
circumflex O
artery O
diameter O
(CxAD) O
without O
simultaneously O
affecting O
any O
other O
cardiac O
or O
systemic O
hemodynamic O
parameter. O
In O
contrast, O
cromakalim O
and O
pinacidil O
at O
all O
doses O
and O
nitroglycerin O
at O
doses O
higher O
than O
0.3 O
micrograms/kg O
simultaneously O
and O
dose-dependently O
increased O
CxAD, O
coronary O
blood O
flow O
and O
heart O
rate O
and O
decreased O
coronary O
vascular O
resistance O
and O
aortic O
pressure. O
Cromakalim O
was O
approximately O
8- O
to O
9.5-fold O
more O
potent O
than O
pinacidil O
in O
increasing O
CxAD. O
Vasodilation O
of O
large O
and O
small O
coronary O
vessels O
and O
hypotension B
induced O
by O
cromakalim O
and O
pinacidil O
were O
not O
affected O
by O
prior O
combined O
beta O
adrenergic O
and O
muscarinic O
receptors O
blockade O
but O
drug-induced O
tachycardia B
was O
abolished. O
When O
circumflex O
artery O
blood O
flow O
was O
maintained O
constant, O
the O
increases O
in O
CxAD O
induced O
by O
cromakalim O
(10 O
micrograms/kg), O
pinacidil O
(30 O
micrograms/kg) O
and O
nitroglycerin O
(10 O
micrograms/kg) O
were O
reduced O
by O
68 O
+/- O
7, O
54 O
+/- O
9 O
and O
1 O
+/- O
1%, O
respectively. O
Thus, O
whereas O
nitroglycerin O
preferentially O
and O
flow-independently O
dilates O
large O
coronary O
arteries, O
cromakalim O
and O
pinacidil O
dilate O
both O
large O
and O
small O
coronary O
arteries O
and O
this O
effect O
is O
not O
dependent O
upon O
the O
simultaneous O
beta O
adrenoceptors-mediated O
rise O
in O
myocardial O
metabolic O
demand. O
Finally, O
two O
mechanisms O
at O
least, O
direct O
vasodilation O
and O
flow O
dependency, O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
cromakalim- O
and O
pinacidil-induced O
increase O
in O
CxAD. O

Mefenamic O
acid-induced O
neutropenia B
and O
renal B
failure I
in O
elderly O
females O
with O
hypothyroidism. B

We O
report O
mefenamic O
acid-induced O
non-oliguric O
renal B
failure I
and O
severe O
neutropenia B
occurring O
simultaneously O
in O
two O
elderly O
females. O
The O
neutropenia O
was O
due O
to O
maturation O
arrest O
of O
the O
myeloid O
series O
in O
one O
patient. O
Both O
patients O
were O
also O
hypothyroid, B
but O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
whether O
this O
was O
a O
predisposing O
factor O
to O
the O
development O
of O
these O
adverse O
reactions. O
However, O

Methyldopa-induced O
hemolytic B

an O
antihypertensive O

which O
is O
available O
generically O
and O
under O
the O
trade O
name O
Aldomet O
that O
is O

Methyldopa O
causes O
an O
autoimmune B
hemolytic B
anemia I
in O
a O
small O
percentage O

who O
take O
the O

We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
methyldopa-induced O
hemolytic O
anemia O
in O
a O
15-year-old O
boy O
who O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency B

with O
near-syncope. O
The B
boy O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
intravenous O
methyldopa O
during O
a O
trauma B
admission O
seven O
weeks O
prior O
to O

resulted O
in O
a O

The O
long-term O
safety O
of O
danazol O
in O
women O
with O
hereditary B
angioedema. I

Although O
the O
short-term O
safety O
(less O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
6 O
months) O
of O
danazol O
has O
been O
established O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
settings, O
no O
information O
exists O
as O
to O
its O
long-term O
safety. O
We O
therefore O
investigated O
the O
long-term O
safety O
of O
danazol O
by O
performing O
a O
retrospective O
chart O
review O
of O
60 O
female O
patients O
with O
hereditary B
angioedema I
treated O
with O
danazol O
for O
a O
continuous O
period O
of O
6 O
months O
or O
longer. O
The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
patients O
was O
35.2 O
years O
and O
the O
mean O
duration O
of O
therapy O
was O
59.7 O
months. O
Virtually O
all O
patients O
experienced O
one O
or O
more O
adverse O
reactions. O
Menstrual B
abnormalities I
(79%), O
weight B
gain I
(60%), O
muscle B
cramps/myalgias I
(40%), B
and O
transaminase O
elevations O
(40%) O
were O
the O
most O
common O
adverse O
reactions. O
The O
drug O
was O
discontinued O
due O
to O
adverse O
reactions O
in O
8 O
patients. O
No O
patient O
has O
died O
or O
suffered O
any O
apparent O
long-term O
sequelae O
that O
were O
directly O
attributable O
to O
the O
drug. O
We O
conclude O
that, O
despite O
a O
relatively O
high O
incidence O
of O
adverse O
reactions, O
danazol O
has O
proven O
to O
be O
remarkably O
safe O
over O
the O
long-term O
in O
this O

Twenty-nine O

was O
a O

The O
0.25 O

was O
closest O
to O

in O

however, O
none O
of O
the O

differed O
statistically O
from O
AgSD O
or O
from O
each O

In O
addition, O
ease O

was O
less O

that O
of O
AgSD. O
It O
was O
concluded O
that O

at O

below O
0.5 O

Dose-dependent O
neurotoxicity B

Busulfan O

its O
acute O

We O
report O
here O
a O
retrospective O
study O
of O
123 O
children O
(median O
age, O
6.5 O

receiving O
high-dose O
busulfan O
in O
combined O
chemotherapy O
before O

Busulfan O
was O
given O
p.o., O
every O
6 O
hours O
for O
16 O

over O
4 O
days. O
Two O
total O
doses O
were O
consecutively O
used: O
16 O
mg/kg, O
then O
600 O
mg/m2. O
The O
dose O
calculation O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
body O
surface O
area O
results O
in O
higher O
doses O
in O
young O
children O
than O
in O
older O
patients O
(16 O
to O
28 O
mg/kg). O
Ninety-six O
patients O
were O
not O
given O
anticonvulsive O
prophylaxis; O
7 O
(7.5%) O
developed O
seizures B
during O
the O
4 O
days O
of O
the O
busulfan O
course O
or O
within O
24 O
h O
after O
the O
last O
dosing. O
When O
the O
total O
busulfan O
dose O
was O
taken O
into O
account, O
there O
was O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O

of O
neurotoxicity O
incidence O
among O
patients O
under O
16 O
mg/kg O
(1 O

1.7%) O
and O
patients O
under O
600 O
mg/m2 O
(6 O
of O
39, O
15.4%) O
(P O
less O
than O
0.02). O
Twenty-seven O
patients O
were O
given O
a O
600-mg/m2 O
busulfan O
total O
dose O
with O
continuous O
i.v. O
infusion O
of O
clonazepam; O
none O
had O
any O
neurological B
symptoms. I
Busulfan O
levels O
were O
measured O
by O
a O

in O
the O

of O
9 O

under O
600 O
mg/m2 O
busulfan O
with O
clonazepam:busulfan O
cerebrospinal O
fluid:plasma O
ratio O
was O
1.39. O
This O
was O
significantly O
different O
(P O
less O
than O
0.02) O
from O
the O
cerebrospinal O
fluid:plasma O
ratio O
previously O
defined O
in O
children O
receiving O
a O
16-mg/kg O
total O
dose O
of O
busulfan. O
This O
study O
shows O
that O
busulfan O
neurotoxicity O
is O
dose-dependent O
in O
children O
and O
efficiently O
prevented O
by O
clonazepam. O
A O
busulfan O
dose O
calculated O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
body O
surface O
area, O
resulting O
in O
higher O
doses O
in O
young O
children, O
was O
followed O
by O
increased O
neurotoxicity, O
close O
to O
neurotoxicity O
incidence O
observed O
in O
adults. O
Since O
plasma O
pharmacokinetic O
studies O
showed O
a O
faster O
busulfan O
clearance O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults, O
this O
new O
dose O
may O
approximate O
more O
closely O
the O
adult O
systemic O
exposure O
obtained O
after O
the O
usual O
16-mg/kg O
total O
dose, O
with O
potential O
inferences O
in O
terms O
of O
anticancer O
or O
myeloablative O
effects. O
The O
busulfan O
dose O
in O
children O
and O
infants O
undergoing O
bone O
marrow O
transplantation O
should O
be O
reconsidered O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

Lindane O
(gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) O
is O
an O

Its O
mechanism O

understood O
although O
it O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
lindane O
acts O
as O
a O
non-competitive O
antagonist O
at O
the O
gamma-aminobutyric O

We O
studied O
the O

lindane O
(150 O
mg/kg) O
on O
the O
GABAergic O

in O

brain O
areas O
at O
the O

All O
animals O
suffered O
tonic O
convulsions B
at O
18.3 O
+/- O
1.4 O
min O
after O
lindane O
administration. O
The O
concentration O
of O
GABA O
was O
only O
slightly O
but O
significantly O
decreased O
in O
the O
colliculi O
without O
modifications O
in O
the O
other O
areas. O
The O
concentration O
of O
dopamine O
was O
increased O
in O
the O
mesencephalon O
and O
that O
of O
its O
metabolite O
DOPAC O
was O
also O
increased O
in O
the O
mesencephalon O
and O
the O

Two O

one O
case O

are O
described. O
The O
literature O
related O
to O
antithyroid O

side O
effects O
and O
the O
mechanisms O
for O

are O
reviewed O
and O
the O

and O
complications O
of O

compared O
to O
those O
of O

drugs. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
in O
most O
circumstances O
131I O
is O
the O
therapy O
of O

for O

Anticonvulsant O
actions O
of O
MK-801 O
on O
the O
lithium-pilocarpine O
model O
of O
status B
epilepticus I
in O
rats. O

MK-801, O
a O
noncompetitive O
N-methyl-D-aspartate O
(NMDA) O
receptor O
antagonist, O
was O
tested O
for O
anticonvulsant O
effects O
in O
rats O
using O
two O
seizure B
models, O
coadministration O
of O
lithium O
and O
pilocarpine O
and O
administration O
of O
a O
high O
dose O
of O
pilocarpine O
alone. O
Three O
major O
results O
are O
reported. O
First, O
pretreatment O
with O
MK-801 O
produced O
an O
effective O
and O
dose-dependent O
anticonvulsant O
action O
with O
the O
lithium-pilocarpine O
model O
but O
not O
with O
rats O
treated O
with O
pilocarpine O
alone, O
suggesting O
that O
different O
biochemical O
mechanisms O
control O
seizures B
in O
these O
two O
models. O
Second, O
the O
anticonvulsant O
effect O
of O
MK-801 O
in O
the O
lithium-pilocarpine O
model O
only O
occurred O
after O
initial O
periods O
of O
seizure O
activity. O
This O
observation O
is O
suggested O
to O
be O
an O
in O
vivo O
demonstration O
of O
the O
conclusion O
derived O
from O
in O
vitro O
experiments O
that O
MK-801 O
binding O
requires O
agonist-induced O
opening O
of O
the O
channel O
sites O
of O
the O
NMDA O
receptor. O
Third, O
although O
it O
is O
relatively O
easy O
to O
block O
seizures O
induced O
by O
lithium O
and O
pilocarpine O
by O
administration O
of O
anticonvulsants O
prior O
to O
pilocarpine, O
it O
is O
more O
difficult O
to O
terminate O
ongoing O
status B
epilepticus I
and O
block O
the O
lethality O
of O
the O
seizures. O
Administration O
of O
MK-801 O
30 O
or O
60 O
min O
after O
pilocarpine, O
i.e., O
during O
status O
epilepticus, O
gradually O
reduced O
electrical O
and O
behavioral O
seizure O
activity O
and O
greatly O
enhanced O
the O
survival O
rate. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
activation O
of O
NMDA O
receptors O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
status O
epilepticus O
and O
brain B
damage I
in O
the O
lithium-pilocarpine O
model. O
This O
was O
further O
supported O
by O
results O
showing O
that O
nonconvulsive O
doses O
of O
NMDA O
and O
pilocarpine O
were O
synergistic, O
resulting O
in O
status O
epilepticus O
and O
subsequent O
mortality. O

Nifedipine O
induced O
bradycardia B
in O
a O
patient O
with O
autonomic B
neuropathy. I

An O
80 O
year O
old O
diabetic B
male O
with O
evidence O
of O
peripheral B
and I
autonomic B
neuropathy I
was O
admitted O
with O
chest B
pain. I
He O
was O
found O
to O
have O
atrial B
flutter I
at O
a O
ventricular O
rate O
of O
70/min O
which O
slowed O
down O
to O
30-40/min O
when O
nifedipine O
(60 O
mg) O
in O
3 O
divided O
doses, O
during O
which O
he O
was O
paced O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
70/min. O
This O
is O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
well-established O
finding O
that O
nifedipine O
induces O
tachycardia B
in O
normally O
innervated O
hearts. O
However, O
in O
hearts O
deprived O
of O
compensatory O
sympathetic O
drive, O
it O
may O
lead O
to O
bradycardia. B

The O
effectiveness O
of O
haloperidol O
pretreatment O
in O
preventing O
the O
toxic O
effects O
of O
high O
doses O
of O
amphetamine O
and O
cocaine O
was O
studied O
in O
rats. O
In O
this O
model, O
toxic O
effects O
were O
induced O
by O
intraperitoneal O
(i.p.) O
injection O
of O
amphetamine O
75 O
mg/kg O
(100% O
death O
rate) O
or O
cocaine O
70 O
mg/kg O
(82% O
death O
rate). O
Haloperidol O
failed O
to O
prevent O
amphetamine-induced O
seizures, B
but O
did O
lower O
the O
mortality O
rate O
at O
most O
doses O
tested. O
Haloperidol O
decreased O
the O
incidence O
of O
cocaine-induced O
seizures O
at O
the O
two O
highest O
doses, O
but O
the O
lowering O
of O
the O
mortality O
rate O
did O
not O
reach O
statistical O
significance O
at O
any O
dose. O
These O
data O
suggest O
a O
protective O
role O
for O
the O
central O
dopamine O
blocker O
haloperidol O
against O
death O

Both O

It O

The O
myocardial O

estimated O
in O
these O
8 O

The O

therefore, O
explain O
this O

The O
rapid O
reversion O
after O

excludes O
the O
possibility O
that O

converted O
the O

Indomethacin, O

ibuprofen, O
10-100 O

Etoposide O
(VP-16-213) O
has O
been O
used O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
many O

hematologic B
malignancies. I
When O
used O
in O
high O

this O

In O
six O
of O

(75%) O
who O
we O
treated O
for O
recurrent O

sudden O

occurred. O
This O
developed O
a O
median O
of O
9 O
days O

Significant O
clinical O

and O
sharp O

These O
abnormalities O
resolved O
rapidly O
after O
initiation O
of O
high-dose O
intravenous O

therapy. O
In O
all O
patients, O
computerized O

demonstrated O
stability O
in O
tumor O

The O

have O
led O
to O
the O

In O

by O
the O

(AMNS) O
and O
protamine O

(PS). O
Male O
Sprague-Dawley O
rats, O
uninephrectomized O
three O

PS O
(2 O

for O
four O
days. O
The O
series O

The O
animals O
were O

on O
days O
24, O
52, O

80. O
They O
developed O
nephrotic B

The O
time-course O

from O
that O
of O
each O

The O

Therefore, O
it O
is O
suggested O
that O
the O
administration O
of O
PS O
enhances O
the O

of O
seizures O
in O
the O
mother O
were O
similar O
to O
maternal O
brain O
and O
CSF O
concentrations O
and O
correlated O
significantly O
with O
the O
former. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
advanced O
pregnancy O
has O
a O
negligible O
effect O
on O
the O

rats. O

Hyperkalemia B
induced O
by O
indomethacin O
and O
naproxen O
and O
reversed O
by O
fludrocortisone. O

We O
have O
described O
a O
patient O
with O
severe O
rheumatoid B
arthritis I
and O
a O
history O
of O
mefenamic O
acid O
nephropathy B
in O
whom O
hyperkalemia B
and O
inappropriate O
hypoaldosteronism B
were O
caused O
by O
both O
indomethacin O
and O
naproxen, O
without O
major O
decline O
in O
renal O
function. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
preexisting O
renal B
disease I
predisposed O
this O
patient O
to O
type B
IV I
renal I
tubular I
acidosis I
with O
prostaglandin O
synthetase O
inhibitors. O
Because O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
discontinue O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drug O
therapy, O
fludrocortisone O
was O
added, O
correcting O
the O
hyperkalemia O
and O
allowing O
indomethacin O
therapy O
to O
be O
continued O
safely. O

Hypotension B
as O
a O
manifestation O
of O
cardiotoxicity B
in O
three O
patients O
receiving O
cisplatin O
and O
5-fluorouracil. O

Cardiac O
symptoms, O
including O
hypotension, B
developed O
in O
three O
patients O
with O
advanced O
colorectal B
carcinoma I
while O
being O
treated O
with O
cisplatin O
(CDDP) O
and O
5-fluorouracil O
(5-FU). O
In O
two O
patients, O
hypotension O
was O
associated O
with O
severe O
left B
ventricular I
dysfunction. I
All O
three O
patients O
required O
therapy O
discontinuation. O
Cardiac O
enzymes O
remained O
normal O
despite O
transient O
electrocardiographic O
(EKG) O
changes. O
The O
presentation O
and O
cardiac O
evaluation O
(hemodynamic, O
echocardiographic, O
and O
scintigraphic) O
of O
these O
patients O
suggest O
new O
manifestations O
of O
5-FU O
cardiotoxicity B
that O
may O
be O
influenced O
by O
CDDP. O
The O
possible O
pathophysiologic O
mechanisms O
are O
discussed. O

Fatal O
aplastic B
anemia I
in O
a O
patient O
treated O
with O
carbamazepine. O

A O
case O
of O
fatal O
aplastic B
anemia I
due O
to O
carbamazepine O
treatment O
in O
an O
epileptic B
woman O
is O
reported. O
Despite O
concerns O
of O
fatal O
bone B
marrow I
toxicity I
due O
to O
carbamazepine, O
this O
is O
only O
the O
fourth O
documented O
and O
published O
report. O
Carbamazepine O
is O
a O
safe O
drug, O
but O
physicians O
and O
patients O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
exceedingly O
rare O
but O
potentially O
fatal O
side O
effects, O
better O
prevented O
by O
clinical O
than O
by O
laboratory O
monitoring. O

Participation O
of O
a O
bulbospinal O
serotonergic O
pathway O
in O
the O
rat O
brain O
in O
clonidine-induced O
hypotension B
and O
bradycardia. B

The O
effects O
of O
microinjection O
of O
clonidine O
(1-10 O
micrograms O
in O
1 O
microliter) O
into O
a O
region O
adjacent O
to O
the O
ventrolateral O
surface O
of O
the O
medulla O
oblongata O
on O
cardiovascular O
function O
were O
assessed O
in O
urethane-anesthetized O
rats. O
Intramedullary O
administration O
of O
clonidine, O
but O
not O
saline O
vehicle, O
caused O
a O
dose-dependent O
decrease O
in O
both O
the O
mean O
arterial O
pressure O
and O
the O
heart O
rate. O
The O
clonidine-induced O
hypotension B
was O
antagonized O
by O
prior O
spinal O
transection, O
but O
not O
bilateral O
vagotomy. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
clonidine-induced O
bradycardia B
was O
antagonized O
by O
prior O
bilateral O
vagotomy, O
but O
not O
spinal O
transection. O
Furthermore, O
selective O
destruction O
of O
the O
spinal O
5-HT O
nerves, O
produced O
by O
bilateral O
spinal O
injection O
of O
5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, O
reduced O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
vasodepressor O
or O
the O
bradycardiac B
responses O
to O
clonidine O
microinjected O
into O
the O
area O
near O
the O
ventrolateral O
surface O
of O
the O
medulla O
oblongata O
in O
rats. O
The O
data O
indicate O
that O
a O
bulbospinal O
serotonergic O
pathway O
is O
involved O
in O
development O
of O
clonidine-induced O
hypotension O
and O
bradycardia. O
The O
induced O
hypotension O
is O
brought O
about O
by O
a O
decrease O
in O
sympathetic O
efferent O
activity, O
whereas O
the O
induced O
bradycardia O
was O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
vagal O
efferent O
activity. O

Hypertension B
in O
neuroblastoma B
induced O
by O
imipramine. O

Hypertension B
is O
a O
well-known O
finding O
in O
some O
patients O
with O
neuroblastoma. B
However, O
it O
has O
not O
previously O
been O
described O
in O
association O
with O
the O
use O
of O
Imipramine. O
We O
report O
the O
occurrence O
of O
severe O
hypertension B
(blood O
pressure O
190/160) O
in O
a O
4-year-old O
girl O
with O
neuroblastoma O
who O
was O
given O
Imipramine O
to O
control O
a O
behavior B
disorder. I
It O
was O
determined O
later O
that O
this O
patient's O
tumor B
was O
recurring O
at O
the O
time O
of O
her O
hypertensive B
episode. O
Since O
she O
had O
no O
blood O
pressure O
elevation O
at O
initial O
diagnosis O
and O
none O
following O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
Imipramine O
(when O
she O
was O
in O
florid O
relapse), O
we O
believe O
that O
this O
drug O
rather O
than O
her O
underlying O
disease O
alone O
caused O
her O
hypertension. O
The O
mechanism O
for O
this O
reaction O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
increased O
levels O
of O
vasoactive O
catecholamines O
due O
to O
interference O
of O
their O
physiologic O
inactivation O
by O
Imipramine. O
From O
this O
experience, O
we O
urge O
extreme O
caution O
in O
the O
use O
of O
tricyclic O
antidepressants O
in O
children O
with O
active O
neuroblastoma. O

Rechallenge O
of O
patients O
who O
developed O
oral B
candidiasis I
or O
hoarseness B
with O
beclomethasone O
dipropionate. O

Of O
158 O
asthmatic B
patients O
who O
were O
placed O
on O
inhaled O
beclomethasone, O
15 O
(9.5%) O
developed O
either O
hoarseness B
(8), O
oral O
thrush B
(6), O
or O
both O
(1). O
When O
their O
adverse O
reactions O
subsided, O
seven O
of O
these O
15 O
patients O
were O
rechallenged O
with O
inhaled O
beclomethasone. O
These O
included O
five O
cases O
who O
developed O
hoarseness O
and O
three O
who O
developed O
Candidiasis. B
One O
patient O
had O
both. O
Oral O
thrush O
did O
not O
recur, O
but O
60% O
(3/5) O
of O
patients O
with O
hoarseness O
had O
recurrence. O
We O
conclude O
that O
patients O
may O
be O
restarted O
on O
inhaled O
beclomethasone O
when O
clinically O
indicated; O
however, O
because O
of O
the O
high O
recurrence O
rate, O
patients O
who O
develop O
hoarseness O
should O
not O
be O
re-challenged. O
Concomitant O
use O
of O
oral O
prednisone O
and O
topical O
beclomethasone O
may O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
hoarseness O
or O
candidiasis. B

Cyclophosphamide O
cardiotoxicity: B
an O
analysis O
of O
dosing O
as O
a O
risk O
factor. O

Patients O
who O
undergo O
bone O
marrow O
transplantation O
are O
generally O
immunosuppressed O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
cyclophosphamide O
(CYA) O
which O
is O
usually O
calculated O
based O
on O
the O
patient's O
weight. O
At O
these O
high O
doses O
of O
CYA, O
serious O
cardiotoxicity B
may B
occur, O
but O
definitive O
risk O
factors O
for O
the O
development O
of O
such O
cardiotoxicity O
have O
not O
been O
described. O
Since O
chemotherapeutic O
agent O
toxicity O
generally O
correlates O
with O
dose O
per O
body O
surface O
area, O
we O
retrospectively O
calculated O
the O
dose O
of O
CYA O
in O
patients O
transplanted O
at O
our O
institution O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
incidence O
of O
CYA O
cardiotoxicity O
correlated O
with O
the O
dose O
per O
body O
surface O
area. O
Eighty O
patients O

were O
to O
receive O
CYA O
50 O
mg/kg/d O

four O
days O

total O
of O
84 O
transplants O
for O
aplastic B

Wiskott-Aldrich B
syndrome, I
or O
severe B

Fourteen O
of O
84 O
(17%) O
patients O
had O
symptoms O
and O
signs O
consistent O
with O
CYA O
cardiotoxicity O
within O
ten O
days O
of O
receiving O
1 O
to O
4 O
doses O
of O
CYA. O
Six O
of O
the O
14 O
patients O
died O
with O
congestive B
heart I
failure. I
The O
dose O
of O
CYA O
per O
body O
surface O
area O
was O
calculated O
for O
all O
patients O
and O
the O
patients O
were O
divided O
into O
two O
groups O
based O
on O
daily O
CYA O
dose: O
Group O
1, O
CYA O
less O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
1.55 O
g/m2/d; O
Group O
2, O
CYA O
greater O
than O
1.55 O
g/m2/d. O
Cardiotoxicity B
that O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
related O
to O
CYA O
occurred O
in O
1/32 O
(3%) O
of O
patients O
in O
Group O
1 O
and O
in O
13/52 O
(25%) O
patients O
in O
Group O
2 O
(P O
less O
than O
0.025). O
Congestive B

caused O
or O
contributed O
to O
death O
in O
0/32 O
patients O
in O
Group O
1 O
v O
6/52 O
(12%) O
of O
patients O
in O
Group O
2 O
(P O
less O
than O
0.25). O
There O
was O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
rate O
of O
engraftment O
of O
evaluable O
patients O
in O
the O
two O
groups O
(P O
greater O
than O
0.5). O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
CYA O
cardiotoxicity O
correlates O
with O
CYA O
dosage O
as O
calculated O
by O
body O
surface O
area, O
and O
that O
patients O
with O
aplastic O
anemia O
and O
immunodeficiencies B
can O
be O
effectively O
prepared O
for O
bone O
marrow O
grafting O
at O
a O
CYA O
dose O
of O
1.55 O
g/m2/d O
for O
four O
days O
with O
a O
lower O
incidence O
of O
cardiotoxicity O
than O
patients O
whose O
CYA O
dosage O
is O
calculated O
based O
on O
weight. O
This O
study O
reaffirms O
the O
principle O
that O
drug O
toxicity O
correlates O
with O
dose O

Studies O
of O
risk O
factors O
for O
aminoglycoside O
nephrotoxicity. B

The O
epidemiology O
of O
aminoglycoside-induced O
nephrotoxicity B
is O
not O
fully O
understood. O
Experimental O
studies O
in O
healthy O
human O
volunteers O
indicate O
aminoglycosides O
cause O
proximal O
tubular O
damage O
in O
most O
patients, O
but O
rarely, O
if O
ever, O
cause O
glomerular B
or I
tubular I
dysfunction. I
Clinical O
trials O
of O
aminoglycosides O
in O
seriously O
ill O
patients O
indicate O
that O
the O
relative O
risk O
for O
developing O
acute B
renal I
failure I
during O
therapy O
ranges O
from O
8 O
to O
10 O
and O
that O
the O
attributable O
risk O
is O
70% O
to O
80%. O
Further O
analysis O
of O
these O
data O
suggests O
that O
the O
duration O
of O
therapy, O
plasma O
aminoglycoside O
levels, O
liver B
disease, I
advanced O
age, O
high O
initial O
estimated O
creatinine O
clearance O
and, O
possibly, O
female O
gender O
all O
increase O
the O
risk O
for O
nephrotoxicity. O
Other O
causes O
of O
acute O
renal O
failure, O
such O
as O
shock, B
appear O
to O
have O
an O
additive O
effect. O
Predictive O

have O
been O
developed O
from O
these O
analyses O
that O
should O
be O
useful O
for O
identifying O
patients O
at O
high O

These O

may O
also O
be O
useful O
in O

the O
pathophysiology O

MSG O
treatment O
resulted O
in O
significant O
reductions O
in O
whole O

but O
did O
not O
alter O

A O

was O
also O
ineffective O
in O
altering O
the O

Flurothyl O

with O
the O
duration O

however, O
the O

The O

The O

suggest O
that O
the O
dipyridamole-induced O
myocardial B

is O
caused O
by O
the O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O

for O
the O

Downbeat B
nystagmus B
is O
often O

but O
has O
occasionally O

In O

nephropathy B
in O
the O

We O
used O

Four O

A O

observed O
in O

Evidence O
for O
a O
cholinergic O
role O
in O
haloperidol-induced O
catalepsy. B

Experiments O
in O
mice O
tested O
previous O
evidence O
that O
activation O
of O
cholinergic O
systems O
promotes O
catalepsy B
and O
that O
cholinergic O
mechanisms O
need O
to O
be O
intact O
for O
full O
expression O
of O
neuroleptic-induced O
catalepsy. O
Large O
doses O
of O
the O
cholinomimetic, O
pilocarpine, O
could O
induce O
catalepsy O
when O
peripheral O
cholinergic O
receptors O
were O
blocked. O
Low O
doses O
of O
pilocarpine O
caused O
a O
pronounced O
enhancement O
of O
the O
catalepsy O
that O
was O
induced O
by O
the O
dopaminergic O
blocker, O
haloperidol. O
A O
muscarinic O
receptor O
blocker, O
atropine, O
disrupted O
haloperidol-induced O
catalepsy. O
Intracranial O
injection O
of O
an O
acetylcholine-synthesis O
inhibitor, O
hemicholinium, O
prevented O
the O
catalepsy O
that O
is O
usually O
induced O
by O
haloperidol. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
catalepsy O
that O
is O
produced O
by O
neuroleptics O
such O
as O
haloperidol O
is O
actually O
mediated O
by O
intrinsic O
central O
cholinergic O
systems. O
Alternatively, O
activation O
of O
central O
cholinergic O
systems O
could O
promote O
catalepsy O
by O
suppression O
of O
dopaminergic O
systems. O

and O
metabolic O
characteristics O
at O
16 O
months O
revealed O
other O
significant O
barium-induced O
disturbances B
within I
the I
cardiovascular I
system. I
The O
most O
distinctive O
aspect O
of O
the O
barium O
effect O
was O
a O
demonstrated O
hypersensitivity B
of O
the O
cardiovascular O
system O
to O
sodium O
pentobarbital. O
Under O
barbiturate O
anesthesia, O
virtually O
all O
of O
the O
myocardial O
contractile O
indices O
were O
depressed O
significantly O
in O
barium-exposed O
rats O
relative O
to O
the O
corresponding O
control-fed O
rats. O
The O
lack O
of O
a O
similar O
response O
to O
ketamine O
and O
xylazine O
anesthesia O
revealed O
that O
the O
cardiovascular O
actions O
of O
sodium O
pentobarbital O
in O
barium-treated O
rats O
were O
linked O
specifically O
to O
this O
anesthetic, O
and O
were O
not O
representative O
of O
a O
generalized O
anesthetic O
response. O
Other O
myocardial O
pathophysiologic O
and O
metabolic O
changes O
induced O
by O
barium O
were O
manifest, O
irrespective O
of O
the O
anesthetic O
employed. O
The O
contractile O
element O
shortening O
velocity O
of O
the O
cardiac O
muscle O
fibers O
was O
significantly O
slower O
in O
both O
groups O
of O
barium-treated O
rats O
relative O
to O
the O
control O
groups, O
irrespective O
of O
the O
anesthetic O
regimen. O
Similarly, O
significant O
disturbances O
in O
myocardial O
energy O
metabolism O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
barium-exposed O
rats O
which O
were O
consistent O
with O
the O
reduced O
contractile O
element O
shortening O
velocity. O
In O
addition, O
the O
excitability O
of O
the O
cardiac O
conduction O
system O
was O
depressed O
preferentially O
in O
the O
atrioventricular O
nodal O
region O
of O
hearts O
from O
barium-exposed O
rats. O
Overall, O
the O
altered O
cardiac O
contractility O
and O
excitability O
characteristics, O
the O
myocardial O
metabolic B
disturbances, I
and O
the O
hypersensitivity O
of O
the O
cardiovascular O
system O
to O
sodium O
pentobarbital O
suggest O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
heretofore O
undescribed O
cardiomyopathic B
disorder I
induced O
by O
chronic O
barium O
exposure. O
These O
experimental O
findings O
represent O
the O
first O
indication O
that O
life-long O
barium O
ingestion O
may O
have O
significant O
adverse O
effects O
on O
the O
mammalian O

Intravenous O
propranolol O
after O

also O
decreased O
blood O

showed O
that O

We O
conclude O
that O
PPA O
increases O
blood O
pressure O
by O
increasing O
systemic O
vascular O
resistance O
and O
cardiac O
output, O
and O
that O
propranolol O
antagonizes O
this O
increase O
by O
reversing O
the O
effect O
of O
PPA O
on O
cardiac O
output. O
That O
propranolol O
antagonizes O
the O
pressor O
effect O
of O
PPA O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
interaction O
in O
which O
propranolol O
enhances O
the O
pressor O
effect O
of O
norepinephrine. O
This O
is O
probably O
because O
PPA O
has O
less O

than O
does O
norepinephrine. O

Mesangial O

The O
possible O

and O
development O
of O

was O
studied O
in O
the O

model. O
Five O
male O
Wistar O

received O
repeated O
subcutaneous O

After O

At O

found O
in O
7.6 O
+/- O
3.4% O
of O
the O

of O

were O
normal. O
Glomeruli O
of O
PAN O

contained O
significantly O
more O
CC O
than O
glomeruli O
of O

Glomeruli O
with O
sclerosis O
contained O
significantly O
more O
CC O
than O
non-sclerotic O

in O
the O

kidneys. O
CC O
was O
preferentially O
localized O
within O
the O

areas O
of O
the O

Since O
mesangial O
CC O

did O
not O
change O
during O
chronic O
PAN O
treatment, O
we O
conclude O
that O
this O
preferential O
CC O
localization O
within O
the O

is O
caused O
by O
an O

shortly O

Relationship O
between O
nicotine-induced O
seizures B
and O
hippocampal O
nicotinic O
receptors. O

A O
controversy O
has O
existed O
for O
several O
years O
concerning O
the O
physiological O
relevance O
of O
the O
nicotinic O
receptor O
measured O
by O
alpha-bungarotoxin O
binding. O
Using O
mice O
derived O
from O
a O
classical O
F2 O
and O
backcross O
genetic O
design, O
a O
relationship O
between O
nicotine-induced O
seizures B
and O
alpha-bungarotoxin O
nicotinic O
receptor O
concentration O
was O
found. O
Mice O
sensitive O
to O
the O
convulsant O
effects O
of O
nicotine O
had O
greater O
alpha-bungarotoxin O
binding O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
than O
seizure O
insensitive O
mice. O
The O
binding O
sites O
from O
seizure O
sensitive O
and O
resistant O
mice O
were O
equally O
affected O
by O
treatment O
with O
dithiothreitol, O
trypsin O
or O
heat. O
Thus O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
difference O
between O
seizure O
sensitive O
and O
insensitive O
animals O
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
difference O
in O
hippocampal O
nicotinic O
receptor O
concentration O
as O
measured O
with O
alpha-bungarotoxin O
binding. O

The O

on O

in O
Fischer O

rats. O

Acetaminophen O
(APAP) O
produces O
proximal O
tubular B
necrosis I
in O
Fischer O
344 O
(F344) O
rats. O
Recently, O
p-aminophenol O
(PAP), O
a O
known O
potent O
nephrotoxicant, O
was O
identified O
as O
a O
metabolite O
of O
APAP O
in O
F344 O
rats. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
if O
PAP O
formation O
is O
a O
requisite O
step O
in O
APAP-induced O
nephrotoxicity. B
Therefore, O
the O
effect O
of O
bis(p-nitrophenyl) O
phosphate O
(BNPP), O
an O
acylamidase O
inhibitor, O
on O
APAP O
and O
PAP O
nephrotoxicity O
and O
metabolism O
was O
determined. O
BNPP O
(1 O
to O
8 O
mM) O
reduced O
APAP O
deacetylation O
and O
covalent O
binding O
in O
F344 O
renal O
cortical O
homogenates O
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
manner. O
Pretreatment O
of O
animals O
with O
BNPP O
prior O
to O
APAP O
or O
PAP O
administration O
resulted O
in O
marked O
reduction O
of O
APAP O
(900 O
mg/kg) O
nephrotoxicity O
but O
not O
PAP O
nephrotoxicity. O
This O
result O
was O
not O
due O
to O
altered O
disposition O
of O
either O
APAP O
or O
acetylated O
metabolites O
in O
plasma O
or O
renal O
cortical O
and O
hepatic O
tissue. O
Rather, O
BNPP O
pretreatment O
reduced O
the O
fraction O
of O
APAP O
excreted O
as O
PAP O
by O
64 O
and O
75% O
after O
APAP O
doses O
of O
750 O
and O
900 O
mg/kg. O
BNPP O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
excretion O
of O
APAP O
or O
any O
of O
its O
non-deacetylated O
metabolites O
nor O
did O
BNPP O
alter O
excretion O
of O
PAP O
or O
its O
metabolites O
after O
PAP O
doses O
of O
150 O
and O
300 O
mg/kg. O
Therefore, O
the O
BNPP-induced O
reduction O
in O
APAP-induced O
nephrotoxicity O
appears O
to O
be O
due O
to O
inhibition O
of O
APAP O
deacetylation. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
PAP O
formation, O
in O
vivo, O
accounts, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
for O
APAP-induced O
renal B
tubular I
necrosis. I

Morphine-induced O
seizures B

Two O
neonates O
suffered O
from O
generalized O
seizures B
during O
the O
course O

intravenous O
morphine O

for O
post-operative O

They O
received O
morphine O
in O
doses O
of O
32 O
micrograms/kg/hr O

40 O
micrograms/kg/hr O
larger O
than O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
neonates O
who O
received O
6-24 O
micrograms/kg/hr O
and O
had O
no O
seizures. O
Plasma O
concentrations O
of O
morphine O
in O
these O
neonates O
was O
excessive O
(60 O
and O
90 O
mg/ml). O
Other O
known O
reasons O
for O
seizures O
were O
ruled O
out O
and O
the O
convulsions B
stopped O
a O
few O
hours O
after O
cessation O
of O
morphine O
and O
did O
not O
reoccur O
in O
the O
subsequent O
8 O
months. O
It O
is O
suggested O
that O
post-operative O
intravenous O
morphine O
should O
not O
exceed O
20 O
micrograms/kg/ml O
in O
neonates. O

These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
an O

predisposes O
to O
severe O

and O
that O

Toxic O
actions O
of O
flurazepam O
(FZP) O
were O
studied O
in O
cats, O
mice O
and O

High O
doses O
caused O
an O
apparent O
central O
excitation, O
most O
clearly O
seen O
as O
clonic O
convulsions, B
superimposed O
on O
general O
depression. B
Following O
a O
lethal O
dose, O
death O
was O
always O
associated O
with O
convulsions. O
Comparing O
the O
relative O
sensitivity O
to O
central O
depression O
and O
excitation O
revealed O
that O
rats O
were O
least O
likely O
to O
have O
convulsions O
at O
doses O
that O
did O
not O
first O
cause O
loss B
of I

while O
cats O
most O
clearly O
showed O
marked O
central O

actions. O
Signs O

toxocity B
in O
cats O
included O
excessive O
salivation, B
extreme O

An O
interaction O
between O
FZP O
and O
pentylenetetrazol O
(PTZ) O
was O
shown O
by O
pretreating O
mice O
with O
FZP O
before O
PTZ O
challenge. O
As O
a O
function O
of O
dose, O
FZP O
first O
protected O
against O
convulsions O
and O
death. O
At O
higher O
doses, O
however, O
convulsions O
again O
emerged. O
These O
doses O
of O
FZP O
were O
lower O
than O
those O
that O
would O
alone O
cause O
convulsions. O
These O
results O
may O
be O
relevant O
to O
the O
use O
of O
FZP O
in O
clinical O
situations O
in O
which O
there O
is O
increased O
neural O
excitability, O
such O
as O

We O
compared O
the O
effects O
of O
single O
doses O
of O
50 O
mg O
atenolol O
(cardioselective), O
40 O
mg O
propranolol O

on O
both O

and O
isoproterenol-induced O
tachycardia B
in O
two O
experiments O
involving O
nine O
normal O

Maximal O

reduced O
from O
187 O
+/- O
4(SEM) O
after O

to O
146 O
+/- O
7 O
bpm O
after O
atenolol O

138 O
+/- O
6 O
bpm O
after O
propranolol, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
differences O
between O
the O
drugs. O
The O
effects O
on O
isoproterenol O
tachycardia O
were O
determined O
before O
and O
after O
atropine O
(0.04 O
mg/kg O
IV). O
Isoproterenol O
sensitivity O
was O
determined O
as O
the O
intravenous O
dose O
that O
increased O
heart O
rate O
by O
25 O
bpm O
(CD25) O
and O
this O
was O
increased O
from O
1.8 O
+/- O
0.3 O
micrograms O
after O
placebo O
to O
38.9 O
+/- O
8.3 O
micrograms O
after O
propranolol O
and O
8.3 O
+/- O
1.7 O
micrograms O
after O
atenolol. O
The O
difference O
in O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
was O
significant. O
After O
atropine O
the O
CD25 O
was O
unchanged O
after O
placebo O
(2.3 O
+/- O
0.3 O
micrograms) O
and O
atenolol O
(7.7 O
+/- O
1.3 O
micrograms); O
it O
was O
reduced O
after O
propranolol O
(24.8 O
+/- O
5.0 O
micrograms), O
but O
remained O
different O
from O
atenolol. O
This O
change O
with O
propranolol O
sensitivity O
was O
calculated O
as O
the O
apparent O
Ka, O
this O
was O
unchanged O
by O
atropine O
(11.7 O
+/- O
2.1 O
and O
10.1 O
+/- O
2.5 O
ml/ng). O
These O
data O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
exercise-induced O
tachycardia O
results O
largely O
from O
beta O
1-receptor O
activation O
that O
is O
blocked O
by O
both O
cardioselective O
and O
nonselective O
drugs, O
whereas O
isoproterenol O
activates O
both O
beta O
1- O
and O
beta O
2-receptors O
so O
that O
after O
cardioselective O
blockade O
there O
remains O
a O
beta O
2-component O
that O
can O
be O
blocked O
with O
a O
nonselective O
drug. O
While O
there O

This O
paper O
reports O
the O
results O
of O
a O
study O
of O
50 O
menopausal O
women O
receiving O
hormonal O
replacement O
therapy. O
The O
majority O
(29) O
had O
surgical O
menopause; O
their O
mean O
age O
was O
45.7 O
years. O
It O
was O
hypothesized O
that O
progestins O
could O
equilibrate O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
estrogenic O
stimulation O
on O
the O
mammary O
and O
endometrial O
target O
tissues O
of O
women O
on O
hormonal O
replacement O
therapy. O
The O
treatment O
schedule O
consisted O
of O
conjugated O
estrogens O
(Premarin) O
1.25 O
mg/day O
for O
21 O
days O
and O
Medroxyprogesterone O
acetate O
10 O
mg/day O
for O
10 O
days O
in O
each O
month. O
The O
mean O
treatment O
period O
was O
18 O
months. O
During O
the O
follow-up O
period, O
attention O
was O
paid O
to O
breast O
modifications O
as O
evidenced O
by O
symptomatology, O
physical O
examination, O
and O
plate O
thermography. O
Mastodynia B
was O
reported O
by O
21 O
patients, O
and O
physical O
examination O
revealed O
a O
light O
increase O
in O
breast O
firmness O
in O
12 O
women O
and O
a O
moderate O
increase O
in O
breast O
nodularity O
in O
2 O
women. O
Themography O
confirmed O
the O
existence O
of O
an O
excessive O
breast O
stimulation O
in O
1 O
women O
who O
complained O
of O
moderate O
mastodynia B
and O
in O
5 O
of O
the O
7 O
women O
who O
complained O
of O
severe O
mastodynia. O
Normalization O
was O
obtained O
by O
halving O
the O
estrogen O
dose. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
hormonal O
replacement O
therapy O
can O
be O
safely O
prescribed O
if O
the O
following O
criteria O
are O
satisfied: O
1) O
preliminary O
evaluation O
of O
patients O
from O
a O
clinical, O
metabolic, O
cytologic, O
and O
mammographic O
perspective; O
2) O
cyclic O
treatment O
schedule, O
with O
a O
progestative O
phase O
of O
10 O
days; O
and O
3) O
periodic O
complete O
follow-up, O
with O
accurate O
thermographic O
evaluation O
of O
the O
breast O

Vasopressin O
as O
a O
possible O
contributor O
to O

The O
role O
of O
vasopressin O
as O
a O
pressor O
agent O
to O
the O
hypertensive B
process O
was O
examined. O
Vasopressin O
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
DOCA-salt O
hypertension, B
since O
the O
elevation O
of O

pressure O
was O
not O
substantial O
in O
the O
rats O
with O
lithium-treated O
diabetes B

Administration O
of O
DDAVP O
which O

antidiuretic O
action O
but O

vasopressor O
effect O
failed O
to O
increase O
blood O
pressure O
to O
the O
levels O
observed O
after O
administration O
of O
AVP. O
Furthermore, O
the O
pressor O
action O
of O
vasopressin O
appears O
to O
be O
important O
in O
the O
development O
of O
this O
model O
of O
hypertension, O
since O
the O
enhanced O
pressor O
responsiveness O
to O
the O
hormone O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
initial O
stage O
of O
hypertension. O
Increased O
secretion O
of O
vasopressin O
from O
neurohypophysis O
also O
promotes O
the O
function O
of O
the O
hormone O
as O
a O
pathogenetic O
factor O
in O
hypertension. O
An O
unproportional O
release O
of O
vasopressin O
compared O
to O
plasma O
osmolality O
may O
be O
induced O
by O
the O

Alternating B
sinus I
rhythm I
and O
intermittent O
sinoatrial B
(S-A) I

was O
observed O
in O
a O
57-year-old O
woman, O
under O
treatment O
for O
angina B
with O
80 O
mg O
propranolol O
daily. O
The O
electrocardiogram O
showed O
alternation O
of O
long O
and O
short O
P-P O
intervals O
and O
occasional O
pauses. O
These O
pauses O
were O
always O
preceded O
by O
the O
short O
P-P O

and O
were O
usually O
followed O
by O
one O
or O
two O
P-P O
intervals O
of O
0.92-0.95 O
s O
representing O
the O
basic O
sinus O
cycle. O
Following O
these O
basic O
sinus O
cycles, O
alternating B
rhythm I
started O
with O
the O
longer O
P-P O
interval. O
The O
long O
P-P O
intervals O
ranged O
between O
1.04-1.12 O

and O
the O
short O
P-P O
intervals O
between O
0.80-0.84 O
s, O
respectively. O
The O
duration O
of O
the O

almost O
equal O
to O
one O

This O

interrupted O
by O
sudden O

time O
and O
with O
occasional O
2/1 O

was O
proposed O
for O
the O
explanation O
of O
the O
alternating O
P-P O
interval O
and O
other O
electrocardiographic O
features O
seen. O
Atropine O
1 O
mg O
given O

resulted O
in O
shortening O
of O
all O
P-P O

without O
changing O
the O

of O
propranolol O
and O
when O
the O

a O
2/1 O
S-A O

In O
conclusion, O
antitumor O

were O
studied O
simultaneously O
in O
the O

Albuminuria B
due O
to O
renal O

led O
to O
extremely O
low O
serum O

so O
ascites B

were O
not O
necessarily O
a O

Intraoperative O

man, O
who O
was O
concurrently O
being O
treated O
with O
pilocarpine O
nitrate O
and O
timolol O
maleate O
eye O
drops, O
developed O
a O
bradycardia B
and O
became O
hypotensive B
during O

Both O
timolol O
and O
pilocarpine O
were O
subsequently O
identified O
in O
a O
24-h O
collection O
of O
urine. O
Timolol O
(but O
not O
pilocarpine) O
was O
detected O
in O
a O

the O
plasma O
concentration O
of O
timolol O
(2.6 O

consistent O
with O
partial O

It O

postulated O
that O
this O
action O
may O
have O
been O
enhanced O
during O
halothane O

with O
resultant O
bradycardia O

Pilocarpine O

Endografine O
in O
142 O
consecutive O

especially O
in O
the O

Hexabrix O
and O
Vasurix O
polyvidone O
are O
considered O
the O
best O
contrast O

perhaps O
because O

Post-suxamethonium O
pains B
in O
Nigerian O
surgical O
patients. O

Contrary O
to O
an O
earlier O
report O
by O
Coxon, O
scoline O
pain B
occurs O
in O
African O
negroes. O
Its O
incidence O
was O
determined O
in O
a O
prospective O
study O
involving O
a O
total O
of O
100 O
Nigerian O
patients O
(50 O
out-patients O
and O
50 O
in-patients). O
About O
62% O
of O
the O
out-patients O
developed O
scoline O
pain O
as O
compared O
with O
about O
26% O
among O
the O
in-patients. O
The O
abolition O
of O
muscle O
fasciculations B
(by O
0.075mg/kg O
dose O
of O
Fazadinium) O
did O
not O
influence O
the O
occurrence O
of O
scoline O
pain. O
Neither O
the O
type O
of O
induction O
agent O
(Althesin O
or O
Thiopentone) O
nor O
the O
salt O
preparation O
of O
suxamethonium O
used O
(chloride O
or O

affected O
the O
incidence O
of O
scoline O
pain. O

Medial O
changes O
in O
arterial O
spasm B
induced O
by O
L-norepinephrine. O

In O
normal O
rats, O
the O
media O
of O
small O
arteries O
(0.4--0.2 O
mm O
in O
diameter) O
previously O
was O
shown O
to O
contain O
intracellular O
vacuoles, O
identified O
ultrastructurally O
as O
herniations O
of O
one O
smooth O
muscle O
cell O
into O
another. O
The O
hypothesis O
that O
intense O
vasoconstriction O
would O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
such O
vacuoles O
has O
been O
tested. O
In O
the O
media O
of O
the O
saphenous O
artery O
and O
its O
distal O
branch, O
vasoconstriction O
induced O
by O
L-norepinephrine O
produced O
many O
cell-to-cell O
hernias B
within O
15 O
minutes. O
At O
1 O
day O
their O
number O
was O
reduced O
to O
about O
1/10 O
of O
the O
original O
number. O
By O
7 O
days O
the O
vessel O
was O
almost O
restored O
to O
normal. O
Triple O
stimulation O
over O
1 O
day O
induced O
more O
severe O
changes O
in O
the O
media. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
smooth O
muscle O
cells O
are O
susceptible O
to O
damage O
in O
the O
course O
of O
their O
specific O
function. O
The O
experimental O

We O
evaluated O
the O

in O
seven O
levodopa-responsive O
patients O
with O
Parkinson's B

of O
fluoxetine O
(20 O
mg O
twice O

After O
fluoxetine O
treatment, O
there O
was O
a O

of O
apomorphine-induced O
dyskinesias O
without O

population-based O
45-day O
follow-up O
study O
of O
232,390 O
people O
who O
were O
prescribed O
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole O
(TMP-SMZ), O
266,951 O
prescribed O
trimethoprim O
alone, O
and O
196,397 O
prescribed O
cephalexin, O
to O
estimate O
the O
risk O
of O
serious O
liver, B
blood, B
skin, B
and I
renal B
disorders I
resulting O
in O
referral O
or O
hospitalization O
associated O
with O
these O
drugs. O
The O
results O
were O
based O
on O
information O
recorded O
on O
office O
computers O
by O
selected O
general O
practitioners O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom, O
together O
with O
a O
review O
of O
clinical O
records. O
The O
risk O
of O
clinically O
important O
idiopathic O
liver B
disease I
was O
similar O
for O
persons O
prescribed O
TMP-SMZ O
(5.2/100,000) O
and O
those O
prescribed O
trimethoprim O
alone O
(3.8/100,000). O
The O
risk O
for O
those O
prescribed O
cephalexin O
was O
somewhat O
lower O
(2.0/100,000). O
Only O
five O
patients O
experienced O
blood O
disorders, O
one O
of O
whom O
was O
exposed O
to O
TMP-SMZ; O
of O
seven O
with O
erythema B
multiforme I
and O
Stevens-Johnson B
syndrome, I
four O
were O
exposed O
to O
TMP-SMZ. O
The O
one O
case O
of O
toxic B
epidermal I
necrolysis I
occurred O
in O
a O
patient O
who O
took O
cephalexin. O
Finally, O
only O
five O
cases O
of O
acute O
parenchymal O
renal B
disease I
occurred, O
none O
likely O
to O
be O
caused O
by O
a O
study O
drug. O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
the O
serious O
diseases O
studied O
is O
small O
for O
the O
three O
agents, O
and O
compares O
reasonably O
with O
the O
risk O
for O
many O
other O
antibiotics. O

Clinical O
safety O
of O
lidocaine O
in O
patients O
with O
cocaine-associated O
myocardial B
infarction. I

STUDY O
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
evaluate O
the O
safety O
of O
lidocaine O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
cocaine-induced O
myocardial B
infarction I
(MI). O
DESIGN: B
A O
retrospective, O
multicenter O
study. O
SETTING: O
Twenty-nine O
university, O
university-affiliated, O
or O
community O
hospitals O
during O
a O
6-year O
period O
(total O
of O
117 O
cumulative O
hospital-years). O
PARTICIPANTS: O
Patients O
with O
cocaine-associated O
MI O
who O
received O
lidocaine O
in O
the O
emergency O
department. O
RESULTS: O
Of O
29 O
patients O
who O
received O
lidocaine O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
cocaine-associated O
MI, O
no O
patient O
died; O
exhibited O
bradydysrhythmias, B
ventricular B
tachycardia, I
or O
ventricular B
fibrillation; I
or O
experienced O
seizures B
after O
administration O
of O
lidocaine O
(95% O
confidence O
interval, O
0% O
to O
11%). O
CONCLUSION: O
Despite O
theoretical O
concerns O
that O
lidocaine O
may O
enhance O
cocaine O
toxicity, B
the O
use O
of O
lidocaine O
in O
patients O
with O
cocaine-associated O
MI O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
significant O
cardiovascular B
or I
central B
nervous I
system I
toxicity. I

Paclitaxel O
(Taxol; O
Bristol-Myers O
Squibb O
Company, O
Princeton, O
NJ) O
by O
3-hour O
infusion O
was O
combined O
with O
carboplatin O
in O
a O
phase O
I/II O
study O
directed O
to O
patients O
with O
non-small B
cell I
lung I
cancer. I
Carboplatin O
was O
given O
at O
a O
fixed O
target O
area O
under O
the O
concentration-time O
curve O
of O
6.0 O
by O
the O
Calvert O
formula, O
whereas O
paclitaxel O
was O
escalated O
in O
patient O
cohorts O
from O
150 O
mg/m2 O
(dose O
level O
I) O
to O
175, O
200, O
225, O
and O
250 O
mg/m2. O
The O
225 O
mg/m2 O
level O
was O
expanded O
for O
the O
phase O
II O
study O
since O
the O
highest O
level O
achieved O
(250 O
mg/m2) O
required O
modification O
because O
of O
nonhematologic O
toxicities B
(arthralgia I
and B
sensory B
neuropathy). I
Therapeutic O
effects O
were O
noted O
at O
all O
dose O
levels, O
with O
objective O
responses O
in O
17 O
(two O
complete O
and O
15 O
partial O
regressions) O
of O
41 O
previously O
untreated O
patients. O
Toxicities B
were O
compared O
with O
a O
cohort O
of O
patients O
in O
a O
phase O
I O
trial O
of O
paclitaxel O
alone O
at O
identical O
dose O
levels. O
Carboplatin O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
add O
to O
the O
hematologic O
toxicities O
observed, O
and O
the O
paclitaxel/carboplatin O
combination O
could O
be O
dosed O
every O
3 O
weeks. O

The O
dose-dependent O
effect O
of O
misoprostol O
on O
indomethacin-induced O
renal B
dysfunction I
in O
well O
compensated O
cirrhosis. B

Misoprostol O
(200 O
micrograms) O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
acutely O
counteract O
the O
indomethacin-induced O
renal B
dysfunction I
in O
well O
compensated O
cirrhotic B
patients. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
if O
the O
prophylactic O
value O
of O
misoprostol O
was O
dose-dependent. O
Parameters O
of O
renal O
hemodynamics O
and O
tubular O
sodium O
and O
water O
handling O
were O
assessed O
by O
clearance O
techniques O
in O
26 O
well O
compensated O
cirrhotic O
patients O
before O
and O
after O
an O
oral O
combination O
of O
50 O
mg O
of O
indomethacin O
and O
various O
doses O
of O
misoprostol. O
The O
200-micrograms O
dose O
was O
able O
to O
totally O
abolish O
the O
deleterious O
renal O
effects O
of O
indomethacin, O
whereas O
the O
800-micrograms O
dose O
resulted O
in O
significant O
worsening O
of O
renal O
hemodynamics O
and O
sodium O
retention. O
These O
changes O
were O
maximal O
in O
the O
hour O
immediately O
after O
medications O
and O
slowly O
returned O
toward O
base-line O
levels O
thereafter. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
renal O
protective O
effects O
of O
misoprostol O
is O
dose-dependent. O
However, O
until O
this O
apparent O
ability O
of O
200 O
micrograms O
of O
misoprostol O
to O
prevent O
the O
adverse O
effects O
of O
indomethacin O
on O
renal O
function O
is O
confirmed O
with O
chronic O
frequent O
dosing, O
it O
would O
be O
prudent O
to O
avoid O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
therapy O
in O
patients O
with O
cirrhosis. B

Increased O
frequency O
and O
severity O
of O
angio-oedema B
related O
to O
long-term O
therapy O
with O
angiotensin-converting O
enzyme O
inhibitor O
in O
two O
patients. O

Adverse O
reactions O
to O
drugs O
are O
well O
recognized O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
acute O
or O
chronic O
urticaria, B
and O
angio-oedema. B
Angiotensin-converting O
enzyme O
(ACE) O
inhibitors, O
used O
to O
treat O
hypertension B
and O
congestive B
heart I
failure, I
were O
introduced O
in O
Europe O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
eighties, O
and O
the O
use O
of O
these O
drugs O
has O
increased O
progressively. O
Soon O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
ACE O
inhibitors, O
acute O
bouts O
of O
angio-oedema O
were O
reported O
in O
association O
with O
the O
use O
of O
these O
drugs. O
We O
wish O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
adverse O
reactions O
to O
ACE O
inhibitors O
after O
long-term O
use O
and O
in O
patients O
with O
pre-existing O
angio-oedema. O

Myoclonus B
associated O
with O
lorazepam O
therapy O
in O
very-low-birth-weight O
infants. O

Lorazepam O
is O
being O
used O
with O
increasing O
frequency O
as O
a O
sedative O
in O
the O
newborn O
and O
the O
young O
infant. O
Concern O
has O
been O
raised O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
safety O
of O
lorazepam O
in O
this O
age O
group, O
especially O
in O
very-low-birth-weight O
(VLBW; O
< O
1,500 O
g) O
infants. O
Three O
young O
infants, O
all O
of O
birth O
weight O
< O
1,500 O
g, O
experienced O
myoclonus B
following O
the O
intravenous O
administration O
of O
lorazepam. O
The O
potential O
neurotoxic B
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
(and O
its O
vehicle) O
in O
this O
population O
are O
discussed. O
Injectable O
lorazepam O
should O
be O
used O
with O
caution O
in O
VLBW O
infants. O

Transvenous O
right O
ventricular O
pacing O
during O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
of O
pediatric O
patients O
with O
acute O
cardiomyopathy. B

We O
describe O
the O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
efforts O
on O
five O
patients O
who O
presented O
in O
acute O
circulatory B
failure I
from O
myocardial B
dysfunction. I
Three O
patients O
had O
acute O
viral O
myocarditis, B
one O
had O
a O
carbamazepine-induced O
acute O
eosinophilic B
myocarditis, I
and O
one O
had O
cardiac O
hemosiderosis O
resulting O
in O
acute O
cardiogenic B
shock. I
All O
patients O
were O
continuously O
monitored O
with O
central O
venous O
and O
arterial O
catheters O
in O
addition O
to O
routine O
noninvasive O
monitoring. O
An O
introducer O
sheath, O
a O
pacemaker, O
and O
sterile O
pacing O
wires O
were O
made O
readily O
available O
for O
the O
patients, O
should O
the O
need O
arise O
to O
terminate O
resistant O
cardiac O
dysrhythmias. B
All O
patients O
developed O
cardiocirculatory O
arrest O
associated O
with O
extreme O
hypotension B
and O
dysrhythmias O
within O
the O
first O
48 O
hours O
of O
their O
admission O
to O
the O
pediatric O
intensive O
care O
unit O
(PICU). O
Right O
ventricular O
pacemaker O
wires O
were O
inserted O
in O
all O
of O
them O
during O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
(CPR). O
In O
four O
patients, O
cardiac O
pacing O
was O
used, O
resulting O
in O
a O
temporary O
captured O
rhythm O
and O
restoration O
of O
their O
cardiac O
output. O
These O
patients O
had O
a O
second O
event O
of O
cardiac B
arrest, I
resulting O
in O
death, O
within O
10 O
to O
60 O
minutes. O
In O
one O
patient, O
cardiac O
pacing O
was O
not O
used, O
because O
he O
converted O
to O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
by O
electrical O
defibrillation O
within O
three O
minutes O
of O
initiating O
CPR. O
We O
conclude O
that O
cardiac O
pacing O
during O
resuscitative O
efforts O
in O
pediatric O
patients O
suffering O
from O
acute O
myocardial O
dysfunction O
may O
not O
have O
long-term O
value O
in O
and O
of O
itself; O
however, O
if O
temporary O
hemodynamic O
stability O
is O
achieved O
by O
this O
procedure, O
it O
may O
provide O
additional O
time O
needed O
to O
institute O
other O
therapeutic O
modalities. O

Efficacy O
and O

receptor O
antagonist, O
in O
the O
prevention O
of O
nausea B

PURPOSE: O
To O
assess O
the O
antiemetic O
effects O
and O
safety O
profile O
of O
four O
different O
doses O
of O
granisetron O
(Kytril; O

when O
administered O
as O
a O
single O
intravenous O
(IV) O
dose O
for O
prophylaxis O
of O
cisplatin-induced O
nausea B
and O
vomiting. B
PATIENTS O
AND O
METHODS: O
One O
hundred O
eighty-four O
chemotherapy-naive O
patients O
receiving O
high-dose O
cisplatin O
(81 O
to O
120 O
mg/m2) O
were O
randomized O
to O
receive O
one O
of O
four O
granisetron O
doses O
(5, O
10, O
20, O
or O
40 O
micrograms/kg) O
administered O
before O
chemotherapy. O
Patients O
were O
observed O
on O
an O
inpatient O
basis O
for O
18 O
to O
24 O
hours, O
and O
vital O
signs, O
nausea, O
vomiting, O
retching, O
and O
appetite O
were O
assessed. O
Safety O
analyses O
included O
incidence O
of O
adverse O
experiences O
and O
laboratory O
parameter O
changes. O
RESULTS: O
After O
granisetron O
doses O
of O
5, O
10, O
20, O
and O
40 O
micrograms/kg, O
a O
major O
response O
(< O
or O
= O
two O
vomiting O
or O
retching O
episodes, O
and O
no O
antiemetic O
rescue) O
was O
recorded O
in O
23%, O
57%, O
58%, O
and O
60% O
of O
patients, O
respectively, O
and O
a O
complete O
response O
(no O
vomiting O
or O
retching, O
and O
no O
antiemetic O
rescue) O
in O
18%, O
41%, O
40%, O
and O
47% O
of O
patients, O
respectively. O
There O
was O
a O
statistically O
longer O
time O
to O
first O
episode O
of O
nausea O
(P O
= O
.0015) O
and O
vomiting O
(P O
= O
.0001), O
and O
fewer O
patients O
were O
administered O
additional O
antiemetic O
medication O
in O
the O
10-micrograms/kg O
dosing O
groups O
than O
in O
the O
5-micrograms/kg O
dosing O
group. O
As O
granisetron O
dose O
increased, O
appetite O
return O
increased O
(P O
= O
.040). O
Headache B
was O
the O
most O
frequently O
reported O
adverse O
event O
(20%). O
CONCLUSION: O
A O
single O
10-, O
20-, O
or O
40-micrograms/kg O
dose O
of O
granisetron O
was O
effective O
in O
controlling O
vomiting O
in O
57% O
to O
60% O
of O
patients O
who O
received O
cisplatin O
at O
doses O
greater O
than O
81 O
mg/m2 O
and O
totally O
prevented O
vomiting O
in O
40% O
to O
47% O
of O
patients. O
There O
were O
no O
statistically O
significant O
differences O
in O
efficacy O
between O
the O
10-micrograms/kg O
dose O
and O
the O
20- O
and O
40-micrograms/kg O
doses. O
Granisetron O
was O
well O
tolerated O
at O
all O
doses. O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
report O
two O
cases O
of O
a O
possible O
adverse O
interaction O
between O
clonidine O
and O
verapamil O
resulting O
in O
atrioventricular B
(AV) I
block I
in O
both O
patients O
and O
severe O
hypotension B
in O
one O
patient. O
CASE O
SUMMARIES: O
A O
54-year-old O
woman O
with O
hyperaldosteronism B
was O
treated O
with O
verapamil O
480 O
mg/d O
and O
spironolactone O
100 O
mg/d. O
After O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
minimal O
dose O
of O
clonidine O
(0.15 O
mg O
bid), O
she O
developed O
complete O
AV B
block I
and O
severe O
hypotension, O
which O
resolved O
upon O
cessation O
of O
all O
medications. O
A O
65-year-old O
woman O
was O
treated O
with O
extended-release O
verapamil O
240 O
mg/d. O
After O
the O
addition O
of O
clonidine O
0.15 O
mg O
bid O
she O
developed O
complete O
AV O
block, O
which O
resolved O
after O
all O
therapy O
was O
stopped. O
DISCUSSION: O
An O
adverse O
interaction O
between O
clonidine O
and O
verapamil O
has O
not O
been O
reported O
previously. O
We O
describe O
two O
such O
cases O
and O
discuss O
the O
various O
mechanisms O
that O
might O
cause O
such O
an O
interaction. O
Clinicians O
should O
be O
acquainted O
with O
this O
possibly O
fatal O
interaction O
between O
two O
commonly O
used O
antihypertensive O
drugs. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Caution O
is O
recommended O
in O
combining O
clonidine O
and O
verapamil O
therapy, O
even O
in O
patients O
who O
do O
not O
have O
sinus O
or O
AV O
node O
dysfunction. O
The O
two O
drugs O
may O
act O
synergistically O
on O
both O
the O
AV O
node O
and O
the O
peripheral O
circulation. O

INTERVENTIONS: O
Administration O
of O
flumazenil O
to O
animals O
after O
they O
had O
received O
a O
combination O
dose O
of O
cocaine O
and O
diazepam. O
RESULTS: O
In O
group O
1, O
animals O
received O
cocaine O
followed O
by O
vehicle. O
This O
resulted O
in O
100% O
developing O
seizures O
and O
death. O
Group O
2 O
received O
diazepam O
alone O
followed O
by O
vehicle. O
Animals O
became O
somnolent O
and O
none O
died. O
Group O
3 O
received O
diazepam O
followed O
by O
5 O
mg/kg O
flumazenil. O
Animals O
became O
somnolent O
after O
diazepam O
and O
then O
active O
after O
flumazenil O
administration. O
In O
group O
4, O
a O
combination O
of O
cocaine O
and O
diazepam O
was O
administered O
simultaneously. O
This O
resulted O
in O
no O
overt O
or O
EEG-detectable O
seizures O
and O
a O
50% O
incidence O
of O
death. O
Group O
5 O
received O
a O
similar O
combination O
of O
cocaine O
and O
diazepam, O
followed O
later O
by O
5 O
mg/kg O
flumazenil. O
This O
resulted O
in O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
seizures, O
90% O
(P O
< O
.01), O
and O
death, O
100% O
(P O
< O
or O
= O
.01), O
compared O
with O
group O
4. O
Group O
6 O
received O
cocaine O
and O
diazepam O
followed O
by O
10 O
mg/kg O
flumazenil. O
This O
also O
resulted O
in O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
seizures, O
90% O
(P O
< O
or O
= O
.01), O
and O
death, O
90% O
(P O
< O
or O

CONCLUSION: O
Flumazenil O
can O
unmask O
seizures O
and O
increase O
the O
incidence O
of O
death O
in O
a O
model O

in O
our O

Protective O

We O

of O
clentiazem, O
a O
1,5-benzothiazepine O
calcium O
antagonist, O
on O
epinephrine-induced O
cardiomyopathy B

With O
2-week O

16 O

died O
within O
4 O
days, O
and O
severe O
ischemic B
lesions I
and O

of O
the O

were O
observed. O
In O
epinephrine-treated O
rats, O
left O
atrial O
and O
left O
ventricular O
papillary O
muscle O
contractile O
responses O
to O
isoproterenol O
were O
reduced, O
but O
responses O
to O
calcium O
were O
normal O
or O
enhanced O
compared O
to O
controls. O
Left O
ventricular O
alpha O
and O
beta O
adrenoceptor O
densities O
were O
also O
reduced O
compared O
to O
controls. O
Treatment O
with O
clentiazem O
prevented O
epinephrine-induced O
death O
(P O
< O
.05), O
and O
attenuated O
the O
ventricular O
ischemic O
lesions O
and O
fibrosis, O
in O
a O
dose-dependent O
manner. O
Left O
atrial O
and O
left O
ventricular O
papillary O
muscle O
contractile O
responses O
to O
isoproterenol O
were O
reduced O
compared O
to O
controls O
in O
groups O
treated O
with O
clentiazem O
alone, O
but O
combined O
with O
epinephrine, O
clentiazem O
restored O
left O
atrial O
responses O
and O
enhanced O
left O
ventricular O
papillary O
responses O
to O
isoproterenol. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
clentiazem O
did O
not O
prevent O
epinephrine-induced O
down-regulation O
of O
alpha O
and O
beta O
adrenoceptors. O
Interestingly, O
clentiazem, O
infused O
alone, O
resulted O
in O
decreased O
adrenergic O
receptor O
densities O
in O
the O
left O
ventricle. O
Clentiazem O
also O
did O
not O
prevent O
the O
enhanced O
responses O
to O
calcium O
seen O
in O
the O
epinephrine-treated O
animals, O
although O
the O
high O
dose O
of O
clentiazem O
partially O
attenuated O
the O
maximal O
response O
to O
calcium O
compared O
to O
epinephrine-treated O

In O
conclusion, O
clentiazem O
attenuated O
epinephrine-induced O
cardiac B
injury, I
possibly O
through O
its O

on O
the O

As O
this O

the O

On O
this O

ICRF-187 O
(50 O

provided O
almost O
full O

These O

were O
confirmed O
by O

The O

indicate O
that O
this O
new O
model O
is O
very O
sensitive O
and O
enables O
monitoring O

These O

in O
a O

that O

Since O
bupivacaine O
and O
epinephrine O
may O
both O
precipitate O
dysrhythmias, B
circulating O
bupivacaine O
during O
regional O
anesthesia O
could O
potentiate O
dysrhythmogenic O
effects O
of O
epinephrine. O
We O
therefore O
examined O
whether O
bupivacaine O
alters O
the O
dysrhythmogenicity O
of O
subsequent O
administration O
of O
epinephrine O
in O
conscious, O
healthy O
dogs O
and O
in O
anesthetized O
dogs O
with O
myocardial B
infarction. I
Forty-one O
conscious O
dogs O
received O
10 O
micrograms.kg-1.min-1 O
epinephrine. O
Seventeen O
animals O
responded O
with O

After O

these O

bupivacaine O
or O

over O
5 O
min, O
followed O
by O
10 O
micrograms.kg-1.min-1 O
epinephrine. O
In O
the O
bupivacaine O
groups, O
epinephrine O
caused O
fewer O
prodysrhythmic O
effects O
than O
without O
bupivacaine. O
VT O
appeared O
in O
fewer O
dogs O
and O
at O
a O
later O
time, O
and O
there O
were O
more O
sinoatrial O
beats O
and O
less O
ectopies. O
Epinephrine O
shortened O
QT O
less O
after O
bupivacaine O
than O
in O
control O
animals. O
One O
day O
after O
experimental O
myocardial O
infarction, O
six O
additional O
halothane-anesthetized O
dogs O
received O
4 O
micrograms.kg-1.min-1 O
epinephrine O
until O
VT O
appeared. O
After O
45 O
min, O
1 O
mg/kg O
bupivacaine O
was O
injected O
over O
5 O
min, O
again O
followed O
by O
4 O
micrograms.kg-1.min-1 O
epinephrine. O
In O
these O
dogs, O
the O
prodysrhythmic O
response O
to O
epinephrine O
was O
also O
mitigated O
by O
preceding O
bupivacaine. O
Bupivacaine O
antagonizes O
epinephrine O
dysrhythmogenicity O
in O
conscious O
dogs O
susceptible O
to O
VT O
and O
in O
anesthetized O
dogs O
with O
spontaneous O
postinfarct O
dysrhythmias. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
systemic O
subtoxic O
bupivacaine O
administration O
enhances O
the O
dysrhythmogenicity O
of O
subsequent O
epinephrine. O

Milk-alkali B
syndrome I
induced O
by O
1,25(OH)2D O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
hypoparathyroidism. B

Milk-alkali B
syndrome I
was O
first O
described O
70 O
years O
ago O
in O
the O
context O
of O
the O
treatment O
of O
peptic B
ulcer B
disease I
with O
large O
amounts O
of O
calcium O
and O
alkali. O
Although O
with O
current O
ulcer O
therapy O
(H-2 O
blockers, O
omeprazole, O
and O
sucralfate), O
the O
frequency O
of O
milk-alkali B
syndrome I
has O
decreased O
significantly, O
the O
classic O
triad O
of O
hypercalcemia, B
alkalosis, B
and O
renal B
impairment I
remains O
the O
hallmark O
of O
the O
syndrome. O
Milk-alkali O
syndrome O
can O
present O
serious O
and O
occasionally O
life-threatening O
illness O
unless O
diagnosed O
and O
treated O
appropriately. O
This O
article O
presents O
a O
patient O
with O
hypoparathyroidism B
who O
was O
treated O
with O
calcium O
carbonate O
and O
calcitriol O
resulting O
in O
two O
admissions O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
milk-alkali O
syndrome. O
The O
patient O
was O
successfully O
treated O
with O
intravenous O
pamidronate O
on O
his O
first O
admission O
and O
with O
hydrocortisone O
on O
the O
second. O
This O
illustrates O
intravenous O
pamidronate O
as O
a O
valuable O
therapeutic O
tool O
when O
milk-alkali O
syndrome O
presents O
as O
hypercalcemic B
emergency. I

Encephalopathy B
during O

This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
encephalopathy B
developed O
in O
the O
course O
of O
amitriptyline O
therapy, O
during O
a O
remission O
of O
unipolar B

This O
patient O
could O
have O
been O
diagnosed O
as O
having O
either O
neuroleptic B
malignant I
syndrome I
(NMS) O
or B
serotonin B
syndrome I
(SS). O
The B
major O
determinant O
of O
the O
symptoms O
may O
have O
been O
dopamine/serotonin O
imbalance O
in O
the O
central O
nervous O
system. O
The O
NMS-like O
encephalopathy O
that O
develops O
in O
association O
with O
the O
use O
of O
antidepressants O
indicates O
that O
NMS O
and O
SS O
are O
spectrum O
disorders O
induced O
by O
drugs O
with O
both O
antidopaminergic O
and O
serotonergic O
effects. O

Ten O
weeks O

The O

produced O
no O
significant O
growth O
(8.9 O

0.5 O
mg O
for O

or O

in O
Brown O

pituitaries. O
An O
F1 O
hybrid O
of O
F344 O
and O

exhibited O
significant O
pituitary O
growth O
after O
10 O
weeks O
of O
DES O
treatment O
with O
an O

26.3 O
+/- O
0.7 O

with O
8.6 O
+/- O
0.9 O

Surprisingly, O
the O
F1 O

tumors O
were O
not O
hemorrhagic O
and O
had O
hemoglobin O

and O
outward O
appearance O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
BN. O
Expression O
of O
both O
growth O
and O
morphological O
changes O
is O
due O
to O
multiple O
genes. O
However, O
while O
DES-induced O
pituitary O
growth O
exhibited O
quantitative, O
additive O
inheritance, O
the O
hemorrhagic O
phenotype O
exhibited O
recessive, O
epistatic O
inheritance. O
Only O
5 O
of O
the O
160 O
F2 O
pituitaries O
exhibited O
the O
hemorrhagic O
phenotype; O
36 O
of O
the O
160 O
F2 O
pituitaries O
were O
in O
the O
F344 O
range O
of O
mass, O
but O
31 O
of O
these O
were O
not O
hemorrhagic, O
indicating O
that O
the O
hemorrhagic O
phenotype O
is O
not O
merely O
a O
consequence O
of O
extensive O
growth. O
The O
hemorrhagic O
F2 O
pituitaries O
were O
all O
among O
the O
most O
massive, O
indicating O
that O
some O
of O
the O
genes O
regulate O
both O
phenotypes. O

on O

We O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
recombinant O
hGH O
exacerbates O
renal O
functional O

structural O
injury O
in O
chronic O
puromycin O
aminonucleoside O
(PAN) O

Therefore, O
we O
examined O
whether O

is O
a O
safer O
alternative O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O

in O

The O
glomerulopathy B
was O
induced O
by O
seven O
serial O

PAN O
over O
12 O
wk. O
Experimental O
animals O
(n O

received O
rhIGF-I, O
400 O
micrograms/d, O
whereas O
control O
rats O
(n O

6) O
received O
the O

rhIGF-I O
improved O
weight O

by O
14% O
(p O

without O
altering O
hematocrit O
or O

Urinary O

was O
unaltered O
by O
rhIGF-I O
treatment O
in O
rats O
with O
chronic O
PAN O

After O
12 O
wk, O
the O
inulin O

was O
higher O
in O
rhIGF-I-treated O
rats, O
0.48 O
+/- O

The O
improvement O
in O
GFR O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
enhanced O
glomerular B
hypertrophy I
or O
increased O
segmental O
glomerulosclerosis, B
tubulointerstitial B

or O
renal O
cortical O
malondialdehyde O
content. O
In O
rats O
with O
PAN O
nephropathy, O
administration O
of O
rhIGF-I O
increased O
IGF-I O
and O
GH O
receptor O
gene O
expression, O
without O
altering O
the O
steady O
state O
level O
of O
IGF-I O
receptor O
mRNA. O
In O
normal O
rats O
with O
intact O
kidneys, O
rhIGF-I O
administration O
(n O

4) O
did O
not O
alter O
weight O

proteinuria, B
GFR, O
glomerular O

renal O

content, O
or O
glomerular O
or O
tubulointerstitial B
damage, I
compared O
with O
untreated O
animals O
(n O

4). O
rhIGF-I O
treatment O
reduced O
the O
steady O

IGF-I O
mRNA O
level O
but O
did O
not O
modify O
gene O
expression O
of O
the O
IGF-I O
or O

We O
conclude O
that: O
1) O
administration O
of O
rhIGF-I O
improves O
growth O
and O
GFR O
in O
rats O
with O
chronic O
PAN O
nephropathy O
and O
2) O
unlike O
rhGH, O
long-term O
use O
of O
rhIGF-I O
does O
not O
worsen O
renal O

Nefiracetam O
is O
a O
novel O
pyrrolidone O
derivative O
which O
attenuates O
scopolamine-induced O
learning B
and I
post-training I
consolidation I
deficits. I
Given O
that O
apomorphine O
inhibits O
passive O
avoidance O
retention O
when O
given O
during O
training O
or O
in O
a O
defined O
10-12h O
post-training O
period, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
ability O
of O
nefiracetam O
to O
attenuate O
amnesia B
induced O
by O
dopaminergic O
agonism. O
A O
step-down O
passive O
avoidance O
paradigm O
was O
employed O
and O
nefiracetam O
(3 O
mg/kg) O
and O
apomorphine O
(0.5 O
mg/kg) O
were O
given O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
during O
training O
and O
at O
the O
10-12h O
post-training O
period O
of O
consolidation. O
Co-administration O
of O
nefiracetam O
and O
apomorphine O
during O
training O
or O
10h O
thereafter O
produced O
no O
significant O
anti-amnesic O
effect. O
However, O
administration O
of O
nefiracetam O
during O
training O
completely O
reversed O
the O
amnesia O
induced O
by O
apomorphine O
at O
the O
10h O
post-training O
time O
and O
the O
converse O
was O
also O
true. O
These O
effects O
were O
not O
mediated O
by O
a O
dopaminergic O
mechanism O
as O
nefiracetam, O
at O
millimolar O
concentrations, O
failed O
to O
displace O
either O
[3H]SCH O
23390 O
or O
[3H]spiperone O
binding O
from O
D1 O
or O
D2 O
dopamine O
receptor O
subtypes, O
respectively. O
It O
is O
suggested O
that O
nefiracetam O
augments O
molecular O
processes O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
events O
which O
ultimately O
lead O
to O
consolidation O
of O
memory. O

Human O
corticotropin-releasing O
hormone O
and O
thyrotropin-releasing O
hormone O
modulate O
the O
hypercapnic B

response O
in O
humans. O

Human O
corticotropin-releasing O
hormone O
(hCRH) O
and O
thyrotropin-releasing O
hormone O
(TRH) O
are O
known O
to O
stimulate O
ventilation O
after O
i.v. O
administration O
in O
humans. O
In O
a O
placebo-controlled, O
single-blind O
study O
we O
aimed O
to O
clarify O
if O
both O
peptides O
act O
by O
altering O
central O
chemosensitivity. O
Two O
subsequent O
CO2-rebreathing O
tests O
were O
performed O
in O
healthy O
young O
volunteers. O
During O
the O
first O
test O
0.9% O
NaCl O
was O
given O
i.v.; O
during O
the O
second O
test O
200 O
micrograms O
of O
hCRH O
(n O
= O
12) O
or O
400 O
micrograms O
of O
TRH O
(n O
= O
6) O
was O
administered O
i.v. O
Nine O
subjects O
received O
0.9% O
NaCl O
i.v. O
during O
both O
rebreathing O
manoeuvres. O
The O
CO2-response O
curves O
for O
the O
two O
tests O
were O
compared O
within O
the O
same O
subject. O
In O
the O
hCRH O
group O
a O
marked O
parallel O
shift O
of O
the O
CO2-response O
curve O
to O
the O
left O
was O
observed O
after O
hCRH O
(P O
< O
0.01). O
The O
same O
effect O
occurred O
following O
TRH O
but O
was O
less O
striking O
(P O
= O
0.05). O
hCRH O
and O
TRH O
caused O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
CO2 O
threshold. O
The O
CO2-response O
curves O
in O
the O
control O
group O
were O
nearly O
identical. O
The O
results O
indicate O
an O
additive O
effect O
of O
both O
releasing O
hormones O
on O
the O
hypercapnic B
ventilatory O
response O
in O
humans, O
presumably O
independent O
of O

safety O
in O
Chinese O
hepatitis O
B O
surface O

Forty-two O
Chinese O
HBsAg O

were O
randomized O
to O
receive O
placebo O
(6 O
patients) O
or O
lamivudine O
orally O
in O
dosages O
of O
25 O
mg, O
100 O
mg, O
or O
300 O
mg O
daily O
(12 O
patients O
for O
each O
dosage). O
The O
drug O
was O
given O
for O
4 O
weeks. O
The O
patients O
were O
closely O
monitored O
clinically, O
biochemically, O
and O
serologically O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
after O

All O
36 O

100 O
mg O
(P O

In O
conclusion, O
a O

Population-based O
study O
of O
risk O
of O
venous B

associated O
with O
various O
oral O
contraceptives. O

BACKGROUND: O
Four O
studies O
published O
since O
December, O
1995, O
reported O
that O
the O
incidence O
of O
venous B
thromboembolism I
(VTE) O
was B
higher O
in O
women O
who O
used O
oral O
contraceptives O
(OCs) O
containing O
the O
third-generation O
progestagens O
gestodene O
or O
desogestrel O
than O
in O
users O
of O
OCs O
containing O
second-generation O
progestagens. O
However, O
confounding O
and O
bias O
in O
the O
design O
of O
these O
studies O
may O
have O
affected O
the O
findings. O
The O
aim O
of O
our O
study O
was O
to O
re-examine O
the O
association O
between O
risk O
of O
VTE O
and O
OC O
use O
with O
a O
different O
study O
design O
and O
analysis O
to O
avoid O
some O
of O
the O
bias O
and O
confounding O
of O
the O
earlier O
studies. O
METHODS: O
We O
used O
computer O
records O
of O
patients O
from O
143 O
general O
practices O
in O
the O
UK. O
The O
study O
was O
based O
on O
the O
medical O
records O
of O
about O
540,000 O
women O
born O
between O
1941 O
and O
1981. O
All O
women O
who O
had O
a O
recorded O
diagnosis O
of O
deep-vein B
thrombosis, B
venous B
thrombosis I
not O
otherwise O
specified, O
or O
pulmonary O
embolus O
during O
the O
study O
period, O
and O
who O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
an O
anticoagulant O
were O
identified O
as O
potential O
cases O
of O
VTE. O
We O
did O
a O
cohort O
analysis O
to O
estimate O
and O
compare O
incidence O
of O
VTE O
in O
users O
of O
the O
main O
OC O
preparations, O
and O
a O
nested O
case-control O
study O
to O
calculate O
the O
odds O
ratios O
of O
VTE O
associated O
with O
use O
of O
different O
types O
of O
OC, O
after O
adjustment O
for O
potential O
confounding O
factors. O
In O
the O
case-control O
study, O
we O
matched O
cases O
to O
controls O
by O
exact O
year O
of O
birth, O
practice, O
and O
current O
use O
of O
OCs. O
We O
used O
a O
multiple O
logistic O
regression O
model O
that O
included O
body-mass O
index, O
number O
of O
cycles, O
change O
in O
type O
of O
OC O
prescribed O
within O
3 O
months O
of O
the O
event, O
previous O
pregnancy, O
and O
concurrent O
disease. O
FINDINGS: O
85 O
women O
met O
the O
inclusion O
criteria O
for O
VTE, O
two O
of O
whom O
were O
users O
of O
progestagen-only O
OCs. O
Of O
the O
83 O
cases O
of O
VTE O
associated O
with O
use O
of O
combined O
OCs, O
43 O
were O
recorded O
as O
deep-vein O
thrombosis, O
35 O
as O
pulmonary O
thrombosis, O
and O
five O
as O
venous O
thrombosis O
not O
otherwise O
specified. O
The O
crude O
rate O
of O
VTE O
per O
10,000 O
woman-years O
was O
4.10 O
in O
current O
users O
of O
any O
OC, O
3.10 O
in O
users O
of O
second-generation O
OCs, O
and O
4.96 O
in O
users O
of O
third-generation O
preparations. O
After O
adjustment O
for O
age, O
the O
rate O
ratio O
of O
VTE O
in O
users O
of O
third-generation O
relative O
to O
second-generation O
OCs O
was O
1.68 O
(95% O
CI O
1.04-2.75). O
Logistic O
regression O
showed O
no O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
risk O
of O
VTE O
between O
users O
of O
third-generation O
and O
second-generation O
OCs. O
Among O
users O
of O
third-generation O
progestagens, O
the O
risk O
of O
VTE O
was O
higher O
in O
users O
of O
desogestrel O
with O
20 O
g O
ethinyloestradiol O
than O
in O
users O
of O
gestodene O
or O
desogestrel O
with O
30 O
g O
ethinyloestradiol. O
With O
all O
second-generation O
OCs O
as O
the O
reference, O
the O
odds O
ratios O
for O
VTE O
were O
3.49 O
(1.21-10.12) O
for O
desogestrel O
plus O
20 O
g O
ethinyloestradiol O
and O
1.18 O
(0.66-2.17) O
for O
the O
other O
third-generation O
progestagens. O
INTERPRETATION: O
The O
previously O
reported O
increase O
in O
odds O
ratio O
associated O
with O
third-generation O
OCs O
when O
compared O
with O
second-generation O
products O
is O
likely O
to O
have O
been O
the O
result O
of O
residual O
confounding O
by O
age. O
The O
increased O
odds O
ratio O
associated O
with O
products O
containing O
20 O
micrograms O
ethinyloestradiol O
and O
desogestrel O
compared O
with O
the O
30 O
micrograms O
product O
is O
biologically O
implausible, O
and O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
result O
of O
preferential O
prescribing O
and, O
thus, O
confounding. O

The O
authors O

Intraperitoneal O
injection O
of O

(5 O
mg/kg) O
prevented O
development O

but O
MK-801 O
(0.5 O

did O
not. O
2. O
An O

in O
the O
pilocarpine-treated O
group. O
Scopolamine O

blocked O
the O
pilocarpine-induced O
electrographic O
seizure, O
MK-801 O
treatment O
augmented O
the O
electrographic O
seizure O
induced O
by O
pilocarpine. O
3. O
Brain B
damage I
was O
assessed O
by O
examining O
the O
hippocampus O
microscopically. O
Pilocarpine O
produced O
neuronal B
death I
in O
the O
hippocampus, O
which O
showed O
pyknotic O
changes. O
Pentobarbital, O
scopolamine O
and O
MK-801 O
protected O
the O
brain B
damage I
by O
pilocarpine, O
though O
in O
the O
MK-801-treated O
group, O
the O
pyramidal O
cells O
of O
hippocampus O
appeared O
darker O
than O
normal. O
In O
all O
treatments, O
granule O
cells O
of O
the O
dentate O
gyrus O
were O
not O
affected. O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O

During O
follow-up, O
seven O
(20%) O

and O
two O

One O

after O
2 O
years O
of O

Torsades B

occurred O
early O
during O

even O
with O

high O
despite O

Therefore O

in O
the O

Chronic O
hyperprolactinemia B
and O
changes O
in O
dopamine O
neurons. O

The O
tuberoinfundibular O
dopaminergic O
(TIDA) O
system O
is O
known O
to O
inhibit O
prolactin O
(PRL) O
secretion. O
In O
young O
animals O
this O
system O
responds O
to O
acute O
elevations O
in O
serum O
PRL O
by O
increasing O
its O
activity. O
However, O
this O
responsiveness O
is O
lost O
in O
aging O
rats O
with O
chronically O
high O
serum O
PRL O
levels. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
induce O
hyperprolactinemia B
in O
rats O
for O
extended O
periods O
of O
time O
and O
examine O
its O
effects O
on O
dopaminergic O
systems O
in O
the O
brain. O
Hyperprolactinemia B
was O
induced O
by O
treatment O
with O
haloperidol, O
a O
dopamine O
receptor O
antagonist, O
and O
Palkovits' O
microdissection O
technique O
in O
combination O
with O
high-performance O
liquid O
chromatography O
was O
used O
to O
measure O
neurotransmitter O
concentrations O
in O
several O
areas O
of O
the O
brain. O
After O
6 O
months O
of O
hyperprolactinemia, O
dopamine O
(DA) O
concentrations O
in O
the O
median O
eminence O
(ME) O
increased O
by O
84% O
over O
the O
control O
group. O
Nine O
months O
of O
hyperprolactinemia O
produced O
a O
50% O
increase O
in O
DA O
concentrations O
in O
the O
ME O
over O
the O
control O
group. O
However, O
DA O
response O
was O
lost O
if O
a O
9-month O
long O
haloperidol-induced O
hyperprolactinemia O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
1 O
1/2 O
month-long O
extremely O
high O
increase O
in O
serum O
PRL O
levels O
produced O
by O
implantation O
of O
MMQ O
cells O
under O
the O
kidney O
capsule. O
There O
was O
no O
change O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
DA, O
norepinephrine O
(NE), O
serotonin O
(5-HT), O
or O
their O
metabolites O
in O
the O
arcuate O
nucleus O
(AN), O
medial O
preoptic O
area O
(MPA), O
caudate O
putamen O
(CP), O
substantia O
nigra O
(SN), O
and O
zona O
incerta O
(ZI), O
except O
for O
a O
decrease O
in O
5-hydroxyindoleacetic O
acid O
(5-HIAA) O
in O
the O
AN O
after O
6-months O
of O
hyperprolactinemia O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
DA O
concentrations O
in O
the O
AN O
after O
9-months O
of O
hyperprolactinemia. O
These O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
hyperprolactinemia O
specifically O
affects O
TIDA O
neurons O
and O
these O
effects O
vary, O
depending O
on O
the O
duration O
and O
intensity O
of O
hyperprolactinemia. O
The O
age-related O
decrease O
in O
hypothalamic O
dopamine O
function O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
increases O
in O
PRL O
secretion. O

Treatment-related O

which O
developed O
from O
acute B

leukemia I
treated O
with O
high-dose O
methotrexate. O
In O
both O
patients, O
the O

was O
more O
pronounced O
near O
the O
base O
of O
the O
brain O
than O
at O
the O

Necropsy O
of O

Possible O
mechanisms O
causing O
such O
a O
leukoencephalopathy O
are O
discussed. O

Thrombotic B

A O
case O
of O
acute B
renal I
failure, I
due O
to O
occlusion B
of I
renal I
vessels I
in O
a O
patient O
with O
acute B
promyelocytic I
leukemia I
(APL) O
treated B
with O
all-trans-retinoic O
acid O
(ATRA) O
and O
tranexamic O
acid O
has O
been O
described O
recently. O
We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
acute O
renal O
failure O
in O
an O
APL O
patient O
treated O
with O
ATRA O
alone. O
This O
case O
further O
supports O
the O
concern O
about O
thromboembolic B
complications O
associated O
with O
ATRA O
therapy O
in O
APL O
patients. O
The O
patients, O
a O
43-year-old O
man, O
presented O
all O
the O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
APL O
and O
was O
included O
in O
a O
treatment O
protocol O
with O
ATRA. O
After O
10 O
days O
of O
treatment, O
he O
developed O
acute O
renal O
failure O
that O
was O
completely O
reversible O
after O
complete O
remission O
of O
APL O
was O
achieved O
and O
therapy O
discontinued. O
We O
conclude O
that O
ATRA O
is O
a O
valid O
therapeutic O
choice O
for O
patients O
with O
APL, O
although O
the O
procoagulant O
tendency O
is O
not O
completely O
corrected. O
Thrombotic B
events, O
however, O
could O
be O
avoided O
by O
using O
low-dose O
heparin. O

Pupillary O
changes O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
stimulant-induced O
mania: B
a O
case O
report. O

A O
30-year-old O
cocaine-dependent O
man O
who O
was O
a O
subject O
in O
a O
study O
evaluating O
the O
anticraving O
efficacy O
of O
the O
stimulant O
medication O
diethylpropion O
(DEP) O
became O
manic B
during O
his O
second O
week O
on O
the O
study O
drug. O
Pupillometric O
changes O
while O
on O
DEP, O
especially O
changes O
in O
the O
total O
power O
of O
pupillary B
oscillation, I
were O
dramatically O
different O
than O
those O
observed O
in O
the O
eight O
other O
study O
subjects O
who O
did O
not O
become O
manic. O
The O
large O
changes O
in O
total O
power O
of O
pupillary O
oscillation O
occurred O
a O
few O
days O
before O
the O
patient O
became O
fully O
manic. O
Such O
medication-associated O
changes O
in O
the O
total O
power O
of O
pupillary O
oscillation O
might O
be O
of O
utility O
in O
identifying O
persons O
at O
risk O
for O
manic-like O
adverse O
effects O
during O
the O
medical O
use O
of O
psychomotor O
stimulants O
or O
sympathomimetic O
agents. O

OBJECTIVE: O
We O
wanted O
to O
test O
whether O
assessment O
of O
both O
a O
central O
pain-related B
signal O
(chemo-somatosensory O
evoked O
potential, O
CSSEP) O
and O
a O
concomitantly O
recorded O
peripheral O
signal O
(negative O
mucosal O
potential, O
NMP) O
allows O
for O
separation O
of O
central O
and O
peripheral O
effects O
of O
NSAIDs. O
For O
this O
purpose, O
experimental O
conditions O
were O
created O
in O
which O
NSAIDs O
had O
previously O
been O
observed O
to O
produce O
effects O
on O
phasic O
and O
tonic O
pain O
by O
either O
central O
or O
peripheral O
mechanisms. O
METHODS: O
According O
to O
a O
double-blind, O
randomised, O
controlled, O
threefold O
cross-over O
design, O
18 O
healthy O
subjects O
(11 O
males, O
7 O
females; O
mean O
age O
26 O
years) O
received O
either O
placebo, O
400 O
mg O
ibuprofen, O
or O
800 O
mg O
ibuprofen. O
Phasic O
pain O
was O
applied O
by O
means O
of O
short O
pulses O
of O
CO2 O
to O
the O
nasal O
mucosa O
(stimulus O
duration O
500 O
ms, O
interval O
approximately O
60 O
s), O
and O
tonic O
pain O
was O
induced O
in O
the O
nasal O
cavity O
by O
means O
of O
dry O
air O
of O
controlled O
temperature, O
humidity O
and O
flow O
rate O
(22 O
degrees O
C, O
0% O
relative O
humidity, O
145 O
ml.s-1). O
Both O
CSSEPs O
as O
central O
and O
NMPs O
as O
peripheral O
correlates O
of O
pain O
were O
obtained O
in O
response O
to O
the O
CO2 O
stimuli. O
Additionally, O
the O
subjects O
rated O
the O
intensity O
of O
both O
phasic O
and O
tonic O
pain O
by O
means O
of O
visual O
analogue O
scales. O
RESULTS: O
As O
described O
earlier, O
administration O
of O
ibuprofen O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
decrease O
in O
tonic O
pain O
but-relative O
to O
placebo-an O
increase O
in O
correlates O
of O
phasic O
pain, O
indicating O
a O
specific O
effect O
of O
ibuprofen O
on O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
pain O
stimuli O
under O
these O
special O
experimental O
conditions. O
Based O
on O
the O
similar O
behaviour O
of O
CSSEP O
and O
NMP, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
the O
pharmacological O
process O
underlying O
this O
phenomenon O
was O
localised O
in O
the O
periphery. O
By O
means O
of O
the O
simultaneous O
recording O
of O
interrelated O
peripheral O
and O
central O
electrophysiologic O
correlates O
of O
nociception, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
separate O
central O
and O
peripheral O
effects O
of O
an O
NSAID. O
The O
major O
advantage O
of O
this O
pain O
model O
is O
the O
possibility O
of O
obtaining O
peripheral O
pain-related O
activity O
directly O
using O
a O
non-invasive O
technique O
in O
humans. O

3 O
months O
after O
a O
previous O
anaesthetic O
where O
ondansetron O

had O
been O
used. O
She O
had O
developed O
a O
severe O
acute O
major B
depression B
disorder I
almost O
immediately O
thereafter, O
possibly O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
a O
serotonin O
antagonist. O
Nine O
years O
before O
she O
had O
experienced O
a O
self-limited O
puerperal O
depressive B
episode. I
Anaesthesia O
with O
a O
propofol O
infusion O
and O
avoidance O
of O
serotonin O
antagonists O
provided O
a O
nausea-free O
postoperative O
course O
without O

of O
the O

The O

was O
similar O
between O

Symptomatic O

did O
not O
occur. O
CNA O
patients O
had O
higher O

during O
treatment, O
which O
may O
reflect O
severity O
of O
illness. O
The O
incidence O

was O
similar. O
We O
conclude O
that O
CNA O

demonstrated O
similar O
profiles O
with O

OBJECTIVE: O
We O
describe O
the O
unique O

in O
six O
HIV-infected B
patients O

CONCLUSION: O
Ureteric B
obstruction I
caused O
by O

Neuroleptic B
malignant I
syndrome I
and O
methylphenidate. O

A O
1-year-old O
female O
presented O
with O
neuroleptic B
malignant I
syndrome I
probably O
caused O
by O
methylphenidate. O
She O
had O
defects O
in O
the O
supratentorial O
brain O
including O
the O
basal O
ganglia O
and O
the O
striatum O
(multicystic O
encephalomalacia) B
due I
to O
severe O
perinatal O
hypoxic-ischemic B
encephalopathy, I
which O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
possible O
predisposing O
factor O
causing O
neuroleptic O
malignant O
syndrome. O
A O
dopaminergic O
blockade O
mechanism O
generally O
is O
accepted O
as O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
this O
syndrome. O
However, O
methylphenidate O
is O
a O
dopamine O
agonist O
via O
the O
inhibition O
of O
uptake O
of O
dopamine, O
and O
therefore O
dopaminergic O
systems O
in O
the O
brainstem O
(mainly O
the O
midbrain) O
and O
the O
spinal O
cord O
were O
unlikely O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
onset O
of O
this O
syndrome. O
A O
relative O
gamma-aminobutyric O
acid-ergic O
deficiency O
might O
occur O
because O
diazepam, O
a O
gamma-aminobutyric O
acid-mimetic O
agent, O
was O
strikingly O
effective. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
patient O
with O
neuroleptic O
malignant O
syndrome O
probably O
caused O
by O
methylphenidate. O

Glibenclamide-sensitive O

The O

helodermin, O
a O
basic O
35-amino O
acid O
peptide O
isolated O
from O
the O
venom O
of O
a O
lizard O
salivary O
gland, O
on O
arterial O

examined O
in O
the O
rat, O
focusing O
on O
the O
possibility O
that O
activation O

is O
involved O
in O
the O
responses. O
The O
results O
were O
also O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
vasoactive O
intestinal O

(VIP). O
Helodermin O
produced O
hypotension B
in O
a O
dose-dependent O
manner O
with O
approximately O
similar O
potency O
and O
duration O
to O
VIP. O
Hypotension B
induced O
by O
both O
peptides O
was O
significantly O
attenuated O
by O
glibenclamide, O
which O
abolished O
a O
levcromakalim-produced O
decrease O
in O
arterial O

pressure. O
Oxyhemoglobin O
did O
not O
affect O
helodermin-induced O
hypotension, O
whereas O
it O
shortened O
the O
duration O
of O
acetylcholine O
(ACh)-produced O
hypotension. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
helodermin-produced O
hypotension O
is O
partly O
attributable O
to O
the O
activation O
of O
glibenclamide-sensitive O
K+ O
channels O
(K(ATP) O

which O
presumably O
exist O

was O
maintained O
within O
the O

for O
25 O

The O
adverse O
events O
during O
combined O

included O
an O

varied O
from O
0.5 O

We O
report O
the O

of O
a O

who O
developed O
acute O
cytolytic O

due O
to O

meloxicam O
is O
the O
first O
nonsteroidal O

2. O
The O
acute O
cytolytic O

occurred O
rapidly O
after O
meloxicam O
administration O
and O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
antinuclear O

suggesting O
a O
hypersensitivity B

This O
first O
case O

demonstrates O
the O
potential O
of O
this O

The O

agent, O
remoxipride O
[(S)-(-)-3-bromo-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,6-dimethoxybenz O

has O
been O
associated O
with O

We O
have O
examined O
the O
ability O
of O
remoxipride, O
three O
pyrrolidine O
ring O
metabolites O
and O
five O
aromatic O
ring O
metabolites O
of O
the O

compound O
to O
induce O
apoptosis O
in O
HL60 O
cells O
and O
human O

(HBMP) O
cells. O
Cells O
were O
treated O
for O
0-24 O
h O
with O
each O
compound O
(0-200 O
microM). O
Apoptosis O
was O
assessed O
by O
fluorescence O
microscopy O
in O
Hoechst O
33342- O
and O
propidium O

samples. O
Results O
were O
confirmed O
by O
determination O
of O
internucleosomal O

for O
HL60 O
cell O
samples O
and O
terminal O
deoxynucleotidyl O

in O
HBMP O
cells. O
The O
catechol O
and O
hydroquinone O
metabolites, O
NCQ436 O
and O
NCQ344, O
induced O
apoptosis O
in O
HL60 O
and O
HBMP O
cells O
in O
a O
time- O
and O
concentration O

manner, O
while O
the O
phenols, O
NCR181, O
FLA873, O
and O
FLA797, O
and O
the O

formed O
by O
oxidation O
of O
the O
pyrrolidine O
ring, O
FLA838, O
NCM001, O
and O
NCL118, O
had O
no O
effect. O
No O
necrosis B
was O
observed O
in O
cells O
treated O
with O
NCQ436 O
but O
NCQ344 O
had O
a O
biphasic O
effect O
in O
both O
cell O
types, O
inducing O
apoptosis O
at O
lower O
concentrations O
and O
necrosis O
at O
higher O
concentrations. O
These O
data O
show O
that O
the O
catechol O
and O
hydroquinone O
metabolites O
of O
remoxipride O
have O
direct O
toxic O
effects O
in O
HL60 O
and O
HBMP O
cells, O
leading O
to O
apoptosis, O
while O
the O
phenol O
metabolites O
were O
inactive. O
Similarly, O
benzene-derived O
catechol O
and O
hydroquinone, O
but O
not O
phenol, O
induce O
apoptosis O
in O
HBMP O
cells O
[Moran O
et O
al., O
Mol. O
Pharmacol., O
50 O
(1996) O
610-615]. O
We O
propose O
that O
remoxipride O
and O
benzene O
may O
induce O
aplastic O
anemia O
via O
production O
of O
similar O
reactive O
metabolites O
and O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
NCQ436 O
and O
NCQ344 O
to O
induce O
apoptosis O
in O
HBMP O
cells O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
mechanism O
underlying O
acquired O
aplastic O
anemia O
that O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
remoxipride. O

In O

is O
that O
the O

RATIONALE: O
NG-nitro-L-arginine O
(L-NOARG), O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
nitric-oxide O
synthase O
(NOS), O
induces O
catalepsy B
in O
mice. O
This O
effect O
undergoes O
rapid O
tolerance, O
showing O
a O
significant O
decrease O
after O
2 O
days O
of O
sub-chronic O
L-NOARG O
treatment. O
Nitric O
oxide O
(NO) O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
influence O
dopaminergic O
neurotransmission O
in O
the O
striatum. O
Neuroleptic O
drugs O
such O
as O
haloperidol, O
which O
block O
dopamine O
receptors, O
also O
cause O
catalepsy O
in O
rodents. O
OBJECTIVES: O
To O
investigate O
the O
effects O
of O
subchronic O
L-NOARG O
treatment O
in O
haloperidol-induced O
catalepsy O
and O
the O
number O
of O

METHODS: O
Male O
albino O
Swiss O
mice O
were O
treated O
sub-chronically O
(twice O
a O
day O
for O
4 O
days) O
with O
L-NOARG O
(40 O
mg/kg O
i.p.) O
or O
haloperidol O
(1 O
mg/kg O
i.p.). O
Catalepsy B
was O
evaluated O
at O
the O

of O
the O

in O
mice O
brain O
regions O
related O

RESULTS: O
L-NOARG O
sub-chronic O
administration O
produced O
tolerance O
of O
L-NOARG O
and O
of O
haloperidol-induced O
catalepsy. O
It O
also O
induced O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
NADPH-d-positive O
cells O
in O
the O
dorsal O
part O
of O
the O
caudate O

nuclei O
compared O
with O
haloperidol O
and O
in O
the O
pedunculopontine O

In O
contrast, O
there O
was O
a O
decrease O
in O
NADPH-d O

number O
in O
the O
substantia O
nigra, O
pars O

in O
both O
haloperidol-treated O
and O

animals. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
results O
give O
further O
support O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
NO O
plays O
a O
role O
in O

RESULTS: O
Both O

Anorexigens O
and O
pulmonary B
hypertension I
in O
the O
United O
States: O
results O
from O
the O
surveillance O
of O
North O
American O
pulmonary O
hypertension. O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
use O
of O
appetite O
suppressants O
in O
Europe O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
primary B
pulmonary B
hypertension I
(PPH). O
Recently, B
fenfluramine O
appetite O
suppressants O
became O
widely O
used O
in O
the O
United O
States O
but O
were O
withdrawn O
in O
September O
1997 O
because O
of O
concerns O
over O
adverse O
effects. O
MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
We O
conducted O
a O
prospective O
surveillance O
study O
on O
patients O
diagnosed O
with O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
at O
12 O
large O
referral O
centers O
in O
North O
America. O
Data O
collected O
on O
patients O
seen O
from O
September O
1, O
1996, O
to O
December O
31, O
1997, O
included O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
and O
its O
severity. O
Patients O
with O
no O
identifiable O
cause O
of O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
were O
classed O
as O
PPH. O
A O
history O
of O
drug O
exposure O
also O
was O
taken O
with O
special O
attention O
on O
the O
use O
of O
antidepressants, O
anorexigens, O
and O
amphetamines. O
RESULTS: O
Five O
hundred O
seventy-nine O
patients O
were O
studied, O
205 O
with O
PPH O
and O
374 O
with O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
from O
other O
causes O
(secondary O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
[SPH]). O
The O
use O
of O
anorexigens O
was O
common O
in O
both O
groups. O
However, O
of O
the O
medications O
surveyed, O
only O
the O
fenfluramines O
had O
a O
significant O
preferential O
association O
with O
PPH O
as O
compared O
with O
SPH O
(adjusted O
odds O
ratio O
for O
use O
> O
6 O
months, O
7.5; O
95% O
confidence O
interval, O
1.7 O
to O
32.4). O
The O
association O
was O
stronger O
with O
longer O
duration O
of O
use O
when O
compared O
to O
shorter O
duration O
of O
use O
and O
was O
more O
pronounced O
in O
recent O
users O
than O
in O
remote O
users. O
An O
unexpectedly O
high O
(11.4%) O
number O
of O
patients O
with O
SPH O
had O
used O
anorexigens. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
magnitude O
of O
the O
association O
with O
PPH, O
the O
increase O
of O
association O
with O
increasing O
duration O
of O
use, O
and O
the O
specificity O
for O
fenfluramines O
are O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies O
indicating O
that O
fenfluramines O
are O
causally O
related O
to O
PPH. O
The O
high O
prevalence O
of O
anorexigen O
use O
in O
patients O
with O
SPH O
also O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O
drugs O
precipitate O
pulmonary O
hypertension O
in O
patients O
with O
underlying O
conditions O
associated O
with O
SPH. O

Clinical O
aspects O
of O
heparin-induced O
thrombocytopenia B
and O
thrombosis B
and O
other O
side O
effects O
of O
heparin O
therapy. O

Heparin, O
first O
used O
to O
prevent O
the O
clotting O
of O
blood O
in O
vitro, O
has O
been O
clinically O
used O
to O
treat O
thrombosis B
for O
more O
than O
50 O
years. O
Although O
several O
new O
anticoagulant O
drugs O
are O
in O
development, O
heparin O
remains O
the O
anticoagulant O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
acute O
thrombotic B
episodes. O
The O
clinical O
effects O
of O
heparin O
are O
meritorious, O
but O
side O
effects O
do O
exist. O
Bleeding B
is O
the O
primary O
untoward O
effect O
of O
heparin. O
Major O
bleeding B
is O
of O
primary O
concern O
in O
patients O
receiving O
heparin O
therapy. O
However, O
additional O
important O
untoward O
effects O
of O
heparin O
therapy O
include O
heparin-induced O
thrombocytopenia, B
heparin-associated O
osteoporosis, B
eosinophilia, B
skin B
reactions, I
allergic B
reactions I
other O
than O
thrombocytopenia, O
alopecia, B
transaminasemia, O
hyperkalemia, B
hypoaldosteronism, B
and O
priapism. B
These O
side O
effects O
are O
relatively O
rare O
in O
a O
given O
individual, O
but O
given O
the O
extremely O
widespread O
use O
of O
heparin, O
some O
are O
quite O
common, O
particularly O
HITT B
and O
osteoporosis. O
Although O
reasonable O
incidences O
of O
many O
of O
these O
side O
effects O
can O
be O
"softly" O
deduced O
from O
current O
reports O
dealing O
with O
unfractionated O
heparin, O
at O
present O
the O
incidences O
of O
these O
side O
effects O
with O
newer O
low O
molecular O
weight O
heparins O
appear O
to O
be O
much O
less O
common. O
However, O
only O
longer O
experience O
will O
more O
clearly O
define O
the O
incidence O
of O
each O
side O
effect O
with O
low O
molecular O
weight O
preparations. O

A O

PURPOSE: O
To O
report O
a O
case O
of O
bilateral O
optic B
neuropathy I
in O
a O
patient O
receiving O
tacrolimus O
(FK O
506, O
Prograf; O
Fujisawa O
USA, O
Inc, O
Deerfield, O
Illinois) O
for O
immunosuppression O
after O
orthotropic O
liver O
transplantation. O
METHOD: O
Case O
report. O
In O
a O
58-year-old O
man O
receiving O
tacrolimus O
after O
orthotropic O
liver O
transplantation, O
serial O
neuro-ophthalmologic O
examinations O
and O
laboratory O
studies O
were O
performed. O
RESULTS: O
The O
patient O
had O
episodic O
deterioration O
of O
vision O
in O
both O
eyes, O
with O
clinical O
features O
resembling O
ischemic B
optic I
neuropathies. I
Deterioration B
of I
vision I
occurred O
despite O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
tacrolimus. O
CONCLUSION: O
Tacrolimus O
and O
other O
immunosuppressive O
agents O
may O
be O
associated O

Recent O
findings O
in O
a O
bipolar B
patient O
receiving O
maintenance O
lithium O
therapy O
who O
developed O
hypercalcemia B
and O
severe O
bradyarrhythmia B
prompted O
the O
authors O
to O
conduct O
a O
retrospective O
study O
of O
bipolar O
patients O
with O
lithium-associated O
hypercalcemia. O
A O
printout O
of O
all O
cases O
of O
hypercalcemia O
that O
presented O
during O
a O
1-year O
period O
was O
generated. O
After O
eliminating O
spurious O
hypercalcemias B
or O
those O
associated O
with O
intravenous O
fluids, O
the O
authors O
identified O
18 O
non-lithium-treated O
patients O
with O
hypercalcemias O
related O
to O
malignancies B
and O
other O
medical O
conditions O
(group O
A) O
and O
12 O
patients O
with O
lithium-associated O
hypercalcemia O
(group O
B). O
Patients O
in O
group O
B O
were O
not O
comparable O
to O
those O
in O
group O
A, O
as O
the O
latter O
were O
medically O
compromised O
and O
were O
receiving O
multiple O
pharmacotherapies. O
Thus, O
two O
control O
groups O
were O
generated: O
group O
C1, O
which O
included O
age- O
and O
sex-comparable O
lithium-treated O
bipolar O
normocalcemic O
patients, O
and O
group O
C2, O
which O
included O
bipolar O
normocalcemic O
patients O
treated O
with O
anticonvulsant O
mood O
stabilizers. O
The O
electrocardiographic O
(ECG) O
findings O
for O
patients O
in O
group O
B O
were O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
patients O
in O
groups O
C1 O
and O
C2. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
these O
groups O
did O
not O
differ O
in O
their O
overall O
frequency O
of O
ECG O
abnormalities; O
however, O
there O
were O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
frequency O
of O
conduction O
defects. O
Patients O
with O
hypercalcemia O
resulting O
from O
medical O
diseases O
and O
bipolar O
patients O
with O
lithium-associated O
hypercalcemia O
had O
significantly O
higher O
frequencies O
of O
conduction O
defects. O
Patients O
in O
group O
A O
had O
significant O
mortality O
at O
2-year O
follow-up O
(28%), O
in O
contrast O
to O
zero O
mortality O
in O
the O
other O
three O
groups. O
The O
clinical O
implications O
of O
these O
findings O
are O
discussed. O

NS-718, O
a O

B, O
is O
effective O
against O

Patterns O
of O
sulfadiazine O
acute B
nephrotoxicity. I

Sulfadiazine O
acute B
nephrotoxicity I
is O
reviving O
specially O
because O
of O
its O
use O
in O
toxoplasmosis B
in O
HIV-positive O
patients. O
We O
report O
4 O
cases, O
one O
of O
them O
in O
a O
previously O
healthy O
person. O
Under O
treatment O
with O
sulfadiazine O
they O
developed O
oliguria, B
abdominal B
pain, I
renal B
failure I
and O
showed O
multiple O
radiolucent O
renal B
calculi I
in O
echography. O
All O
patients O
recovered O
their O
previous O
normal O
renal O
function O
after O
adequate O
hydration O
and O
alcalinization. O
A O
nephrostomy O

had O
to O
be O
placed O
in O
one O
of O
the O
patients O
for O
ureteral B
lithiasis I
in O
a O
single O
functional O
kidney. O
None O
of O
them O
needed O
dialysis O
or O
a O
renal O
biopsy O
because O
of O
a O
typical O
benign O
course. O
Treatment O
with O
sulfadiazine O
requires O
exquisite O
control O
of O
renal O
function, O
an O
increase O
in O
water O
ingestion O
and O
possibly O
the O
alcalinization O
of O
the O
urine. O
We O
communicate O
a O
case O
in O
a O
previously O
healthy O
person, O
a O
fact O
not O
found O
in O
the O
recent O
literature. O
Probably O
many O
more O
cases O
are O
not O
detected. O
We O
think O
that O
a O
prospective O
study O
would O
be O
useful. O

The O
hemodynamic O
and O
antiadrenergic O
effects O
of O
dronedarone, O
a O
noniodinated O
compound O
structurally O
related O
to O
amiodarone, O
were O

both O
at O

All O

randomly O
received O
orally O
dronedarone O
(10 O
and O

mg/kg), O
amiodarone O
(10 O
and O
30 O
mg/kg), O
and O

(FS), O
as O
well O
as O
chronotropic O
response O
to O

conditions. O
Resting O
values O
of O
LVEF, O
FS, O

and O
MBP O
remained O
unchanged O
whatever O
the O
drug O
and O
the O

regimen, O
whereas O
resting O
HR O
was O
significantly O
and O
dose-dependently O
lowered O
after O
dronedarone O
and O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
after O
amiodarone. O
Both O
dronedarone O
and O
amiodarone O
significantly O
reduced O
the O
exercise-induced O
tachycardia B
and, O
at O
the O
highest O
dose, O
decreased O
the O
isoproterenol-induced O
tachycardia. O
Thus, O
dronedarone O
and O
amiodarone O
displayed O
a O
similar O
level O
of O
antiadrenergic O
effect O
and O
did O
not O
impair O
the O
resting O
left O
ventricular O
function. O
Consequently, O
dronedarone O
might O
be O
particularly O
suitable O
for O
the O
treatment O
and O
prevention O
of O
various O
clinical O
arrhythmias, B
without O
compromising O
the O
left O

PURPOSE: O
To O
assess O
the O
effect O
of O
pupil B

ability. O
METHODS: O
A O
series O
of O
tests O
on O
various O
parameters O
of O
visual O
function O
and O
driving O
simulator O
performance O
were O
performed O
on O
12 O
healthy O
drivers, O
before O
and O
after O
pupil O
dilation O
using O
guttae O
tropicamide O
1%. O
A O
driving O
simulator O
(Transport O
Research O
Laboratory) O
was O
used O
to O
measure O
reaction O
time O
(RT), O
speed O
maintenance O
and O
steering O
accuracy. O
Tests O
of O
basic O
visual O
function O
included O
high- O
and O
low-contrast O
visual O
acuity O
(HCVA O
and O
LCVA), O
Pelli-Robson O
contrast O
threshold O
(CT) O
and O
Goldmann O
perimetry O
(FIELDS). O
Useful O
Field O
of O
View O
(UFOV--a O
test O
of O
visual O
attention) O
was O
also O
undertaken. O
The O
mean O
differences O
in O
the O
pre- O
and O
post-dilatation O
measurements O
were O
tested O
for O
statistical O
significance O
at O
the O
95% O
level O
using O
one-tail O
paired O
t-tests. O
RESULTS: O
Pupillary B
dilation I
resulted O
in O
a O
statistically O
significant O
deterioration O
in O
CT O
and O
HCVA O
only. O
Five O
of O
12 O
drivers O
also O
exhibited O
deterioration O
in O
LCVA, O
CT O
and O
RT. O
Little O
evidence O
emerged O
for O
deterioration O
in O
FIELDS O
and O
UFOV. O
Also, O
7 O
of O
12 O
drivers O
appeared O
to O
adjust O
their O
driving O
behaviour O
by O
reducing O
their O
speed O
on O
the O
driving O
simulator, O
leading O
to O
improved O
steering O
accuracy. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Pupillary O
dilation O
may O
lead O
to O
a O
decrease O
in O
vision O
and O
daylight O
driving O
performance O
in O
young O
people. O
A O
larger O
study, O
including O
a O

BACKGROUND: O
Treatment O
with O
angiotensin-converting O
enzyme O
(ACE) O
inhibitors O
reduces O
mortality O
and O
morbidity O
in O
patients O
with O
chronic O
heart B
failure I
(CHF), O
but B
most O
affected O
patients O
are O
not O
receiving O
these O
agents O
or O
are O
being O
treated O
with O
doses O
lower O
than O
those O
found O
to O
be O
efficacious O
in O
trials, O
primarily O
because O
of O
concerns O
about O
the O
safety O
and O
tolerability O
of O
these O
agents, O
especially O
at O
the O

METHODS: O
The O
Assessment O

in O
only O
4.2% O

OBJECTIVES: O
Simultaneous O
abuse B
of I
cocaine I
and I
ethanol I
affects O
12 O
million O
Americans O
annually. O
In O
combination, O
these O
substances O
are O
substantially O
more O
toxic O
than O
either O
drug O
alone. O
Their O
combined O
cardiac B
toxicity I
may O
be O
due O
to O
independent O
effects O
of O
each O
drug; O
however, O
they O
may O
also O
be O
due O
to O
cocaethylene O
(CE), O
a O
cocaine O
metabolite O
formed O
only O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
ethanol. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
delineate O
the O
role O
of O
CE O
in O
the O
combined O
cardiotoxicity B
of O
cocaine O
and O

in O
a O
model O
simulating O
their O

were O
obtained O
at O

administered. O
RESULTS: O
Two O
of O
eight O

observed O
in O
the O

in O
which O
four O
of O
eight O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Cocaine O
and O

in O
combination O
were O
more O
toxic O
than O
either O

warning. O

A O
group O
of O
doctors O
in O
Boston O
warn O
that O
the O
protease O
inhibitor O
Viracept O
may O
cause O
an O
irregular B
heart I
beat, I
known O
as O
bradycardia, B
in O
people O
with O
HIV. O
Bradycardia B
occurred O
in O
a O
45-year-old O
male O
patient O
who O
was O
Viracept O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
anti-HIV O
drugs. O
The O

disease I
patients O
treated O
with O
propylthiouracil O
and O
the O
relationship O
between O
MPO-ANCA O
and O
clinical O
manifestations. O

OBJECTIVE: O
Myeloperoxidase O
antineutrophil O
cytoplasmic O
antibody O
(MPO-ANCA)-positive O
vasculitis B
has O
been O
reported O
in O
patients O
with O
Graves' B
disease I
who O
were O
treated O
with O
propylthiouracil O
(PTU). O
The O
appearance O
of O
MPO-ANCA O
in O
these O
cases O
was O
suspected O
of O
being O
related O
to O
PTU O
because O
the O
titres O
of O
MPO-ANCA O
decreased O
when O
PTU O
was O
stopped. O
Nevertheless, O
there O
have O
been O
no O
studies O
on O
the O
temporal O
relationship O
between O
the O
appearance O
of O
MPO-ANCA O
and O
vasculitis O
during O
PTU O
therapy, O
or O
on O
the O
incidence O
of O
MPO-ANCA O
in O
untreated O
Graves' O
disease O
patients. O
Therefore, O
we O
sought O
to O
address O
these O
parameters O
in O
patients O
with O
Graves' O
disease. O
PATIENTS: O
We O
investigated O
102 O
untreated O
patients O
with O
hyperthyroidism B
due O
to O
Graves' O
disease O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
MPO-ANCA, O
and O
for O
the O
development O
vasculitis O
after O
starting O
PTU O
therapy. O
Twenty-nine O
of O
them O
were O
later O
excluded O
because O
of O
adverse O
effects O
of O
PTU O
or O
because O
the O
observation O
period O
was O
less O
than O
3 O
months. O
The O
remaining O
73 O
patients O
(55 O
women O
and O
18 O
men), O
all O
of O
whom O
were O
examined O
for O
more O
than O
3 O
months, O
were O
adopted O
as O
the O
subjects O
of O
the O
investigation. O
The O
median O
observation O
period O
was O
23.6 O
months O
(range: O
3-37 O
months). O
MEASUREMENTS: O
MPO-ANCA O
was O
measured O
at O
intervals O
of O
2-6 O
months. O
RESULTS: O
Before O
treatment, O
the O
MPO-ANCA O
titres O
of O
all O
102 O
untreated O
Graves' O
disease O
patients O
were O
within O
the O
reference O
range O
(below O
10 O
U/ml). O
Three O
(4.1%) O
of O
the O
73 O
patients O
were O
positive O
for O
MPO-ANCA O
at O
13, O
16 O
and O
17 O
months, O
respectively, O
after O
the O
start O
of O
PTU O
therapy. O
In O
two O
of O
them, O
the O
MPO-ANCA O
titres O
transiently O
increased O
to O
12.8 O
and O
15.0 O
U/ml, O
respectively, O
despite O
continued O
PTU O
therapy, O
but O
no O
vasculitic B
disorders I
developed. O
In O
the O
third O
patient, O
the O
MPO-ANCA O
titre O
increased O
to O
204 O
U/ml O
and O
she O
developed O
a O
higher O
fever, B
oral B
ulcers I
and O
polyarthralgia, B
but O
the O
symptoms O
resolved O
2 O
weeks O
after O
stopping O
PTU O
therapy, O
and O
the O
MPO-ANCA O
titre O
decreased O
to O
20.7 O
U/ml O
by O
4 O
months O
after O
discontinuing O
PTU. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
PTU O
therapy O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
appearance O
of O
MPO-ANCA, O
but O
MPO-ANCA O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
closely O
related O
to O
vasculitis. O

in O
outpatient O
young O
asymptomatic O
chronic O
cocaine O

35 O
cocaine O
users O
and O
32 O
age-matched O

underwent O
resting O

Findings O
consistent O
with O
coronary B

were O
detected O
in O
12 O
(34%) O
patients O
and O
3 O
(9%) O
controls O
(p O
= O
0.01). O
Decreased O
left O
ventricular O

was O
demonstrated O
in O
5 O
(14%) O
patients, O
but O
in O
none O
of O
the O
controls O
(p O
= O
0.055). O
Finally, O
resting O

was O
detected O
in O
38 O
and O
35% O
of O

to O
19 O
and O
9% O
of O
controls, O
respectively O
(p O
= O
0.11 O
and O
0.02, O
respectively). O
We O
conclude O
that O
coronary B
artery I
or I
myocardial B
disease I
is O
common O
(38%) O
in O
young O
asymptomatic O
chronic O
cocaine O

Therefore, O
screening O

may O
be O

(1 O

micromol/L), O
leading O
to O
QT O

and O
an O

in O
TDR. O
Azimilide, O
however, O
significantly O
prolonged O

at O
concentrations O
from O
0.1 O
to O
10 O

but O
shortened O
them O
at O
30 O

Unlike O
dl-sotalol, O
azimilide O
(>3 O
micromol/L) O
increased O
epicardial O
APD O
markedly, O
causing O
a O
diminished O
TDR. O
Although O
both O
dl-sotalol O
and O
azimilide O
rarely O
induced O
EADs O
in O
canine O
left O
ventricles, O
they O
produced O
frequent O
EADs O
in O
rabbits, O
in O
which O
more O
pronounced O
QT O

was O
seen. O
An O
increase O
in O
TDR O
by O
dl-sotalol O
facilitated O
transmural O

that O
initiated O
multiple O

of O
spontaneous O

Of O
note, O
although O
azimilide O
(3 O
to O
10 O
micromol/L) O
increased O
APD O
more O
than O
dl-sotalol, O
its O
EADs O
often O
failed O
to O
propagate O
transmurally, O
probably O
because O
of O

CONCLUSIONS: O
This O

provides O
the O
first O

PURPOSE: O
Prenatal O
cocaine O
exposure O
has O
been O
linked O
with O
subependymal O

and O
the O
formation O
of O
cysts B
that O
are O
detectable O
on O

We O
sought O
to O
determine O
if O
prenatal O
cocaine O

METHODS: O
We O
retrospectively O

obtained O
during O
a O
1-year O
period O
on O
122 O
premature B

into O
1 O
of O
2 O
groups: O
those O
exposed O
to O
cocaine O
and O
those O
not O
exposed O
to O
cocaine. O
Infants O
were O
assigned O
to O
the O
cocaine-exposed O
group O
if O
there O
was O
a O

RESULTS: O
Five O
of O
the O
122 O

CONCLUSIONS: O
We O
found O
an O
increased O
incidence O

Thalidomide O
neuropathy B
in O
patients O
treated O
for O
metastatic O
prostate B
cancer. I

We O
prospectively O
evaluated O
thalidomide-induced O
neuropathy B
using O
electrodiagnostic O
studies. O
Sixty-seven O
men O
with O
metastatic O
androgen-independent O
prostate B
cancer I
in O
an O
open-label O
trial O
of O
oral O
thalidomide O
underwent O
neurologic O
examinations O
and O
nerve O
conduction O
studies O
(NCS) O
prior O
to O
and O
at O
3-month O
intervals O
during O
treatment. O
NCS O
included O
recording O
of O
sensory O
nerve O
action O
potentials O
(SNAPs) O
from O
median, O
radial, O
ulnar, O
and O
sural O
nerves. O
SNAP O
amplitudes O
for O
each O
nerve O
were O
expressed O
as O
the O
percentage O
of O
its O
baseline, O
and O
the O
mean O
of O
the O
four O
was O
termed O
the O
SNAP O
index. O
A O
40% O
decline O
in O
the O
SNAP O
index O
was O
considered O
clinically O
significant. O
Thalidomide O
was O
discontinued O
in O
55 O
patients O
for O
lack O
of O
therapeutic O
response. O
Of O
67 O
patients O
initially O
enrolled, O
24 O
remained O
on O
thalidomide O
for O
3 O
months, O
8 O
remained O
at O
6 O
months, O
and O
3 O
remained O
at O
9 O
months. O
Six O
patients O
developed O
neuropathy. O
Clinical O
symptoms O
and O
a O
decline O
in O
the O
SNAP O
index O
occurred O
concurrently. O
Older O
age O
and O
cumulative O
dose O
were O
possible O
contributing O
factors. O
Neuropathy B
may O
thus O
be O
a O
common O
complication O
of O
thalidomide O
in O
older O
patients. O
The O
SNAP O
index O
can O
be O
used O
to O
monitor O
peripheral B
neuropathy, I
but O
not O
for O
early O
detection. O

Overexpression O
of O
copper/zinc-superoxide O
dismutase O
protects O
from O
kanamycin-induced O
hearing B
loss. I

The O
participation O
of O
reactive O
oxygen O
species O
in O
aminoglycoside-induced O
ototoxicity B
has O
been O
deduced O
from O
observations O
that O
aminoglycoside-iron O
complexes O
catalyze O
the O
formation O
of O
superoxide O
radicals O
in O
vitro O
and O
that O
antioxidants O
attenuate O
ototoxicity O
in O
vivo. O
We O
therefore O
hypothesized O
that O
overexpression O
of O
Cu/Zn-superoxide O
dismutase O
(h-SOD1) O
should O
protect O
transgenic O
mice O
from O
ototoxicity. O
Immunocytochemistry O
confirmed O
expression O
of O
h-SOD1 O
in O
inner O
ear O
tissues O
of O
transgenic O
C57BL/6-TgN[SOD1]3Cje O
mice. O
Transgenic O
and O
nontransgenic O
littermates O
received O
kanamycin O
(400 O
mg/kg O
body O
weight/day) O
for O
10 O
days O
beginning O
on O
day O
10 O
after O
birth. O
Auditory O
thresholds O
were O
tested O
by O
evoked O
auditory O
brain O
stem O
responses O
at O
1 O
month O
after O
birth. O
In O
nontransgenic O
animals, O
the O
threshold O
in O
the O
kanamycin-treated O
group O
was O
45-50 O
dB O
higher O
than O
in O
saline-injected O
controls. O
In O
the O
transgenic O
group, O
kanamycin O
increased O
the O
threshold O
by O
only O
15 O
dB O
over O
the O
respective O
controls. O
The O
effects O
were O
similar O
at O
12 O
and O
24 O
kHz. O
The O
protection O
by O
overexpression O
of O
superoxide O
dismutase O
supports O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
oxidant O
stress O
plays O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
aminoglycoside-induced O
ototoxicity. O
The O
results O
also O
suggest O
transgenic O
animals O
as O
suitable O
models O
to O
investigate O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
and O
possible O
strategies O
for O
prevention. O

Prednisone O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
assess O
whether O
prednisone O
(PDN) O
produces O
anxiety B
and/or O
cerebral O
glial O

in O
rats. O
METHODS: O
Male O
Wistar O
rats O
were O
studied O
and O
3 O
groups O
were O
formed O
(8 O
rats O
per O
group). O
The O
moderate-dose O

from O
a O
subcutaneous O
implant. O
In O
the O
high-dose O
group, O

equivalent O
to O
60 O
mg/kg/day O
were O
applied. O
In O
the O
control O
group O
implants O
contained O
no O
PDN. O
Anxiety B
was O
assessed O
using O
an O
open O
field O
and O
elevated O
plus-maze O
devices. O
The O
number O
of O
cells O
and O
cytoplasmic O
transformation O
of O
astrocytes O
and O
microglia O
cells O
were O
assessed O
by O
immunohistochemical O
analyses. O
RESULTS: O
Anxiety O
was O
documented O
in O
both O
groups O
of O
PDN O
treated O

compared O
with O
controls. O
The O
magnitude O
of O
transformation O
of O
the O
microglia O
assessed O
by O
the O
number O
of O

was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
the O
PDN O

was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
the O
PDN O

were O
significantly O
more O

Unpublished O
reports O
were O
requested O
from O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
(WHO) O
and O
the O
Food O
and O
Drug O
Administration O
(FDA). O
Twenty-one O
reports O
of O
antimicrobial-induced O
mania O
were O
found O
in O
the O
literature. O
There O
were O
6 O
cases O
implicating O
clarithromycin, O
13 O
implicating O
isoniazid, O
and O
1 O
case O
each O
implicating O
erythromycin O
and O
amoxicillin. O
The O
WHO O
reported O
82 O
cases. O
Of O
these, O
clarithromycin O
was O
implicated O
in O
23 O
(27.6%) O
cases, O
ciprofloxacin O
in O
12 O
(14.4%) O
cases, O
and O
ofloxacin O
in O
10 O
(12%) O
cases. O
Cotrimoxazole, O
metronidazole, O
and O
erythromycin O
were O
involved O
in O
15 O
reported O
manic O
episodes. O
Cases O
reported O
by O
the O
FDA O
showed O
clarithromycin O
and O
ciprofloxacin O
to O
be O
the O
most O
frequently O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
mania. O
Statistical O
analysis O
of O
the O
data O
would O
not O
have O
demonstrated O
a O
significant O
statistical O

and O
was O
therefore O
not O
undertaken. O
Patients O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
mania O
while O
being O
treated O
with O
antimicrobials. O
Although O
this O
is O
not O
a O
statistically O
significant O
risk, O
physicians O
must O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
effect O
and O
reversibility. O
Further O
research O
clearly O
is O
required O
to O
determine O
the O
incidence O
of O
antimicrobial-induced O
mania, O
the O
relative O
risk O
factors O
of O
developing O
an O
antimicrobial-induced O
manic O

among O
various O
demographic O
populations, O
and O

Primary O
dysmenorrhea B
is O
a O
syndrome O
characterized O
by O
painful B
uterine O
contractility O
caused O
by O
a O
hypersecretion O
of O
endometrial O
prostaglandins; O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
are O
the O
first O
choice O
for O
its O
treatment. O
However, O
in O

and O
in O

studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
myometrial O
cells O
are O
also O
targets O
of O
the O
relaxant O
effects O
of O
nitric O

(NO). O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
efficacy O
of O
glyceryl O
trinitrate O
(GTN), O
an O
NO O

in O
the O
resolution O
of O
primary O

(DCF). O
A O
total O
of O
24 O
patients O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
severe O
primary O
dysmenorrhea O
were O
studied O
during O
two O
consecutive O
menstrual O
cycles. O
In O
an O
open, O
cross-over, O
controlled O
design, O
patients O
were O
randomized O
to O
receive O
either O
DCF O
per O
os O
or O
GTN O
patches O
the O
first O
days O
of O
menses, O
when O
menstrual O
cramps O
became O
unendurable. O
In O
the O
subsequent O
cycle O
the O
other O
treatment O
was O
used. O
Patients O
received O
up O
to O
3 O
doses/day O
of O
50 O
mg O
DCF O
or O
2.5 O
mg/24 O
h O
transdermal O
GTN O
for O
the O
first O
3 O
days O
of O
the O
cycle, O
according O
to O
their O
needs. O
The O
participants O
recorded O
menstrual O
symptoms O
and O
possible O
side-effects O
at O
different O
times O
(0, O
30, O
60, O
120 O
minutes) O
after O
the O
first O
dose O
of O
medication O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
the O
cycle, O
with O
both O
drugs. O
The O
difference O
in O
pain O
intensity O
score O
(DPI) O
was O
the O
main O
outcome O
variable. O
Both O
treatments O
significantly O
reduced O
DPI O
by O
the O
30th O
minute O
(GTN, O
-12.8 O
+/- O
17.9; O
DCF, O
-18.9 O
+/- O
16.6). O
However, O
DCF O
continued O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
reducing O
pelvic B
pain I
for O
two O
hours, O
whereas O
GTN O
scores O
remained O
more O
or O
less O
stable O
after O
30 O

and O
significantly O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
DFC O
(after O
one O

GTN, O
-12.8 O
+/- O

Eight O
patients O
stopped O

PURPOSE: O
This O
retrospective O
study O
used O
a O
pharmaceutical O
company's O
global O
safety O
database O
to O
determine O
the O
reporting O
rate O
of O

and/or O
syndrome B
of I
inappropriate I
secretion I
of I
anti-diuretic I

(SIADH) O
among B
vincristine-treated O
patients O
and O
to O
explore O
the O
possibility O
of O

METHOD: O
We O
searched O
the O
Eli O
Lilly O
and O
Company's O
computerized O
adverse O
event O
database O
for O
all O
reported O
cases O
of O
hyponatremia O
and/or O
SIADH O
as O
of O
1 O
November O
1999 O
that O
had O
been O
reported O
during O
the O
use O
of O
vincristine. O
RESULTS: O
A O
total O
of O
76 O
cases O
of O
hyponatremia O
and/or O
SIADH O
associated O
with O
vincristine O
use O
were O
identified. O
The O
overall O
reporting O
rate O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
1.3/100,000 O
treated O
patients. O
The O
average O
age O
of O
patients O
was O
35.6 O
+/- O
28.3 O
years, O
and O
62% O
were O
males. O
Approximately O
75% O
of O
the O
patients O
were O
receiving O
treatment O
for O
leukemia B
or O
lymphoma. B
Among O
the O
39 O
reports O
that O
included O
information O
on O
race, O
the O
racial O
distribution O
was: O
1 O
Black, O
3 O
Caucasian, O
and O
35 O
Asian. O
CONCLUSION: O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
Asian O
patients O
may O
be O
at O
increased O
risk O
of O
hyponatremia O
and/or O
SIADH O
associated O
with O
vincristine O
use. O
Although O
the O
overall O
reported O
rate O
of O
SIADH O
associated O
with O
vincristine O
is O
very O
low, O
physicians O
caring O
for O
Asian O
oncology O
patients O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
this O
potential O
serious O
but O
reversible O
adverse O
event. O

Delayed O

of O
DBA/2 O
and O
C57BL/6 O
female O
mouse. O

The O
present O
study O
describes O
the O
delayed O
development O
of O
a O
severe O
bladder O
pathology O
in O
a O
susceptible O
strain O
of O
mice O
(DBA/2) O
but O
not O
in O
a O
resistant O
strain O
(C57BL/6) O
when O
both O
were O
treated O
with O
a O
single O
300 O
mg/kg O
dose O
of O
cyclophosphamide O
(CY). O
Inbred O
DBA/2 O
and O
C57BL/6 O
female O
mice O
were O
injected O
with O
CY, O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
drug O
on O
the O
bladder O
was O
assessed O
during O
100 O
days O
by O
light O
microscopy O
using O
different O
staining O
procedures, O
and O
after O
30 O
days O
by O
conventional O
electron O
microscopy. O
Early O
CY O
toxicity B
caused O
a O
typical O
haemorrhagic B
cystitis B
in O
both O
strains O
that O
was O
completely O
repaired O
in O
about O
7-10 O
days. O
After O
30 O
days O
of O
CY O
injection O
ulcerous O
and O
non-ulcerous O
forms O
of O
chronic O
cystitis O
appeared O
in O
86% O
of O
DBA/2 O
mice O
but O
only O
in O
4% O
of O
C57BL/6 O
mice. O
Delayed O
cystitis O
was O
characterized O
by O
infiltration O
and O
transepithelial O
passage O
into O
the O
lumen O
of O
inflammatory O
cells O
and O
by O
frequent O
exfoliation O
of O
the O
urothelium. O
Mast O
cells O
appeared O
in O
the O
connective O
and O
muscular O
layers O
of O
the O
bladder O
at O
a O
much O
higher O
number O
in O
DBA/2 O
mice O
than O
in O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
or O
untreated O
controls. O
Electron O
microscopy O
disclosed O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
typical O
discoidal O
vesicles O
normally O
present O
in O
the O
cytoplasm O
of O
surface O
cells. O
Instead, O
numerous O
abnormal O
vesicles O
containing O
one O
or O
several O
dark O
granules O
were O
observed O
in O
the O
cytoplasm O
of O
cells O
from O
all O
the O
epithelial O
layers. O
Delayed O
cystitis O
still O
persisted O
in O
DBA/2 O
mice O
100 O
days O
after O
treatment. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
delayed O
toxicity O
of O
CY O
in O
female O
DBA/2 O
mice O
causes O
a O
bladder O
pathology O
that O
is O
not O
observed O
in O
C57BL/6 O
mice. O
This O
pathology O
resembles O
interstitial B
cystitis I
in O
humans O
and O
could O
perhaps O
be O
used O
as O
an O
animal O
model O
for O
studies O
on O
the O

(Sermion). O
A O
50-year-old O
patient O
admitted O
to O
our O
hospital O
for O

Before O
admission, O
he O
had O
been O
taking O
nicergoline O
and O
bendazac O
lysine O
due O
to O
retinal B
vein I
occlusion I
at O
ophthalmologic O
department. O
Thereafter, O
he O
experienced O
intermittent O

On O
admission, O
clinical O
symptoms O
(i.e. O
arthralgia B
and O
fever) O
and O
laboratory O
findings O
(i.e. O
eosinophilia B
and O
renal O
failure) O
suggested O
AIN, O
and O
which O
was O
confirmed O
by O
pathologic O
findings O
on O
renal O

against O
nicergoline. O
Treatment O
was O
consisted O
of O
withdrawal O
of O
nicergoline O
and O
intravenous O
methylprednisolone, O
and O
his O
renal O

suggests O
that O
NMS O
in O
a O

may O
be O
complicated O
by O
intestinal O

and O
needs O
special O
caution O

The O
asymmetrical O
breakdown O
of O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB) O
was O
studied O
in O
female O
rats. O
Paw O
preference O
was O
assessed O
by O
a O
food O

test. O
Adrenaline-induced O
hypertension B
was O
used O
to O
destroy O
the O
BBB, O
which O
was O
evaluated O
using O
triphenyltetrazolium O
(TTC) O
staining O
of O
the O
brain O
slices O
just O
after O
giving O
adrenaline O
for O
30 O
s. O
In O
normal O
rats, O
the O
whole O
brain O
sections O
exhibited O
complete O
staining O
with O
TTC. O
After O
adrenaline O
infusion O
for O
30 O
s, O
there O
were O
large O
unstained O
areas O
in O
the O
left O

in O
right-pawed O
animals, O
and O

in O
left-pawed O
animals. O
Similar O
results O
were O
obtained O
in O
seizure-induced B
breakdown O
of O

These O
results O
were O
explained O
by O
an O
asymmetric O
cerebral O
blood O

depending O
upon O
the O
paw O

It O
was O
suggested O
that O
this O
new O
method O
and O
the O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
contralateral O
motor O

Carvedilol O
protects O
against O
doxorubicin-induced O
mitochondrial O
cardiomyopathy. B

Several O
cytopathic O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
suggested O
to O
mediate O
the O
dose-limiting O
cumulative O
and O
irreversible O
cardiomyopathy B
caused O
by O
doxorubicin. O
Recent O
evidence O
indicates O
that O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
mitochondrial B
dysfunction I
are O
key O
factors O
in O
the O
pathogenic O
process. O
The O
objective O
of O
this O
investigation O
was O
to O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
carvedilol, O
a O
nonselective O
beta-adrenergic O
receptor O
antagonist O
with O
potent O
antioxidant O
properties, O
protects O
against O
the O
cardiac O
and O
hepatic O
mitochondrial O
bioenergetic O
dysfunction O
associated O
with O
subchronic O
doxorubicin O
toxicity. B
Heart O

were O
isolated O
from O

treated O
for O
7 O

with O
doxorubicin O
(2 O
mg/kg O

carvedilol O
(1 O
mg/kg O

or O
the O
combination O
of O
the O

Heart O

respiration O
(336 O
+/- O

versus O
425 O
+/- O
53 O

and O
a O
lower O
respiratory O
control O
ratio O
(RCR) O
(4.3 O
+/- O
0.6 O
versus O
5.8 O
+/- O
0.4) O
compared O
with O
cardiac O

isolated O
from O
saline-treated O

Mitochondrial O
calcium-loading O
capacity O
and O
the O
activity O
of O
NADH-dehydrogenase O
were O
also O
suppressed O
in O
cardiac O
mitochondria O
from O
doxorubicin-treated O
rats. O
Doxorubicin O
treatment O
also O
caused O
a O
decrease O
in O
RCR O
for O
liver O
mitochondria O
(3.9 O
+/- O
0.9 O
versus O
5.6 O
+/- O
0.7 O
for O
control O
rats) O
and O
inhibition O
of O
hepatic O

activity. O
Coadministration O
of O
carvedilol O
decreased O
the O
extent O
of O
cellular O
vacuolization O
in O
cardiac O
myocytes O
and O
prevented O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
doxorubicin O
on O
mitochondrial O
respiration O
in O
both O
heart O
and O
liver. O
Carvedilol O
also O
prevented O
the O
decrease O
in O
mitochondrial O
Ca(2+) O
loading O
capacity O
and O
the O
inhibition O
of O
the O
respiratory O
complexes O
of O
heart O

caused O
by O
doxorubicin. O
Carvedilol O
by O
itself O
did O
not O
affect O
any O
of O
the O
parameters O
measured O
for O
heart O
or O
liver O
mitochondria. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
this O
protection O
by O
carvedilol O
against O
both O
the O
structural O
and O
functional O
cardiac O
tissue O
damage O
may O
afford O
significant O
clinical O
advantage O
in O
minimizing O
the O
dose-limiting O
mitochondrial O

that O

Cocaine-induced O
hyperactivity B
is O
more O
influenced O
by O
adenosine O
receptor O
agonists O
than O
amphetamine-induced O
hyperactivity. O

The O
influence O
of O
adenosine O
receptor O
agonists O
and O
antagonists O
on O
cocaine-and O
amphetamine-induced O
hyperactivity B
was O
examined O
in O
mice. O
All O
adenosine O
receptor O
agonists O
significantly O
decreased B
the I
locomotor I
activity I
in O
mice, O
and O
the O
effects O
were O
dose-dependent. O
It O
seems O
that O
adenosine O
A1 O
and O
A2 O
receptors O
might O
be O
involved O
in O
this O
reaction. O
Moreover, O
all O
adenosine O
receptor O
agonists: O
2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine O
(CGS O
21680), O
A2A O
receptor O
agonist, O
N6-cyclopentyladenosine O
(CPA), O
A1 O
receptor O
agonist, O
and O
5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine O
(NECA), O
A2/A1 O
receptor O
agonist O
significantly O
and O
dose-dependently O
decreased O
cocaine-induced O
locomotor O
activity. O
CPA O
reduced O
cocaine O
action O
at O
the O
doses O
which, O
given O
alone, O
did O
not O
influence O
motility, O
while O
CGS O
21680 O
and O
NECA O
decreased O
the O
action O
of O
cocaine O
at O
the O
doses O
which, O
given O
alone, O
decreased O
locomotor O
activity O
in O
animals. O
These O
results O
suggest O
the O
involvement O
of O
both O
adenosine O
receptors O
in O
the O
action O
of O
cocaine O
although O
agonists O
of O
A1 O
receptors O
seem O
to O
have O
stronger O
influence O
on O
it. O
The O
selective O
blockade O
of O
A2 O
adenosine O
receptor O
by O
DMPX O
(3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine) O
significantly O
enhanced O
cocaine-induced O
locomotor O
activity O
of O
animals. O
Caffeine O
had O
similar O
action O
but O
the O
effect O
was O
not O
significant. O
CPT O
(8-cyclopentyltheophylline)--A1 O
receptor O
antagonist, O
did O
not O
show O
any O
influence O
in O
this O
test. O
Similarly, O
all O
adenosine O
receptor O
agonists O
decreased O
amphetamine-induced O
hyperactivity, O
but O
at O
the O
higher O
doses O
than O
those O
which O
were O
active O
in O
cocaine-induced O
hyperactivity. O
The O
selective O
blockade O
of O
A2 O
adenosine O
receptors O
(DMPX) O
and O
non-selective O
blockade O
of O
adenosine O
receptors O
(caffeine) O
significantly O
increased O
the O
action O
of O
amphetamine O
in O
the O
locomotor O
activity O
test. O
Our O
results O
have O
shown O
that O
all O
adenosine O
receptor O
agonists O
(A1 O
and O
A2) O
reduce O
cocaine- O
and O
amphetamine-induced O
locomotor O
activity O
and O
indicate O
that O
cocaine-induced O
hyperactivity O
is O
more O
influenced O
by O
adenosine O
receptor O
agonists O
(particularly O
A1 O
receptors) O
than O
amphetamine-induced O
hyperactivity. O

Amiodarone O

OBJECTIVES: O
The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
use O
of O
amiodarone O
in O
patients O
with O
atrial B

(AF) O
increases B
the O
risk O
of O
bradyarrhythmia B

BACKGROUND: O
Reports O
of O
severe O
bradyarrhythmia O
during O
amiodarone O
therapy O
are O
infrequent O
and O
limited O
to O
studies O
assessing O
the O
therapy's O
use O
in O
the O

METHODS: O
A O

1999. O
Using O
a O
nested O
case-control O
design, O
477 O
cases O
of O
bradyarrhythmia O
requiring O
a O
permanent O
pacemaker O
were O
matched O
(1:4) O
to O
1,908 O

Multivariable O
logistic O

was O
used O
to O
estimate O
the O

to O
sotalol, O
Class O
I O
antiarrhythmic O
agents, O
beta-blockers, O
calcium O
channel O

and O
digoxin. O
RESULTS: O
amiodarone O
use O
was O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
pacemaker O
insertion O
(OR: O
2.14, O
95% O

(OR: O
1.78, O

CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
study O
suggests O
that O
the O
use O
of O
amiodarone O
in O
elderly O
patients O
with O
AF O
and O
a O
previous O

The O
finding O
of O
an O
augmented O
risk O
of O

in O
elderly O
women O
receiving O
amiodarone O
requires O
further O

OBJECTIVES: O
To O
evaluate O
the O
morphologic O
changes O
in O
rat O
urothelium O
induced O
by O
indomethacin. O
Nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drug-induced O
cystitis B
is O
a O
poorly O
recognized O
and O
under-reported O
condition. O
In O
addition O
to O
tiaprofenic O
acid, O
indomethacin O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
this O
condition. O
METHODS: O
Three O
groups O
were O
established: O
a O
control O
group O
(n O
= O
10), O
a O
high-dose O
group O
(n O
= O
10), O
treated O
with O
one O
intraperitoneal O
injection O
of O
indomethacin O
20 O
mg/kg, O
and O
a O
therapeutic O
dose O
group O
(n O
= O
10) O
in O
which O
oral O
indomethacin O
was O
administered O
3.25 O
mg/kg O
body O
weight O
daily O
for O
3 O
weeks. O
The O
animals O
were O
then O
killed O
and O
the O
bladders O
removed O
for O
light O
and O
electron O
microscopic O
studies. O
RESULTS: O
The O
light O
microscopic O
findings O
showed O
some O
focal O
epithelial O
degeneration O
that O
was O
more O
prominent O
in O
the O
high-dose O
group. O
When O
compared O
with O
the O
control O
group, O
both O
indomethacin O
groups O
revealed O
statistically O
increased O
numbers O
of O
mast O
cells O
in O
the O
mucosa O
(P O
<0.0001) O
and O
penetration O
of O
lanthanum O
nitrate O
through O
intercellular O
areas O
of O
the O
epithelium. O
Furthermore, O
the O
difference O
in O
mast O
cell O
counts O
between O
the O
high O
and O
therapeutic O
dose O
groups O
was O
also O
statistically O
significant O
(P O
<0.0001). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Indomethacin O
resulted O
in O
histopathologic O
findings O
typical O
of O
interstitial B
cystitis, I
such O
as O
leaky O
bladder O
epithelium O
and O
mucosal O
mastocytosis. B
The O
true O
incidence O
of O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drug-induced O
cystitis O
in O
humans O
must O
be O
clarified O
by O
prospective O
clinical O
trials. O

An O
open-label O
phase O
II O
study O
of O
low-dose O
thalidomide O
in O
androgen-independent O
prostate B
cancer. I

The O
antiangiogenic O
effects O
of O
thalidomide O
have O
been O
assessed O
in O
clinical O
trials O
in O
patients O
with O
various O
solid O
and O
haematological B
malignancies. I
Thalidomide O
blocks O
the O
activity O
of O
angiogenic O
agents O
including O
bFGF, O
VEGF O
and O
IL-6. O
We O
undertook O
an O
open-label O
study O
using O
thalidomide O
100 O
mg O
once O
daily O
for O
up O
to O
6 O
months O
in O
20 O
men O
with O
androgen-independent O
prostate B
cancer. I
The O
mean O
time O
of O
study O
was O
109 O
days O
(median O
107, O
range O
4-184 O
days). O
Patients O
underwent O
regular O
measurement O
of O
prostate-specific O
antigen O
(PSA), O
urea O
and O
electrolytes, O
serum O
bFGF O
and O
VEGF. O
Three O
men O
(15%) O
showed O
a O
decline O
in O
serum O
PSA O
of O
at O
least O
50%, O
sustained O
throughout O
treatment. O
Of O
16 O
men O
treated O
for O
at O
least O
2 O
months, O
six O
(37.5%) O
showed O
a O
fall O
in O
absolute O
PSA O
by O
a O
median O
of O
48%. O
Increasing O
levels O
of O
serum O
bFGF O
and O
VEGF O
were O
associated O
with O
progressive O
disease; O
five O
of O
six O
men O
who O
demonstrated O
a O
fall O
in O
PSA O
also O
showed O
a O
decline O
in O
bFGF O
and O
VEGF O
levels, O
and O
three O
of O
four O
men O
with O
a O
rising O
PSA O
showed O
an O
increase O
in O
both O
growth O
factors. O
Adverse O
effects O
included O
constipation, B
morning O
drowsiness, B
dizziness B
and O
rash, B
and O
resulted O
in O
withdrawal O
from O
the O
study O
by O
three O
men. O
Evidence O
of O
peripheral B
sensory I
neuropathy I
was O
found O
in O
nine O
of O
13 O
men O
before O
treatment. O
In O
the O
seven O
men O
who O
completed O
six O
months O
on O
thalidomide, O
subclinical O
evidence O
of O
peripheral B
neuropathy I
was O
found O
in O
four O
before O
treatment, O
but O
in O
all O
seven O
at O
repeat O
testing. O
The O
findings O
indicate O
that O
thalidomide O
may O
be O
an O
option O
for O
patients O
who O
have O
failed O
other O
forms O
of O
therapy, O
provided O
close O
follow-up O
is O
maintained O
for O
development O
of O
peripheral O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
OBJECTIVES: O
Central B
nervous I
system I
and I
cardiac B
toxicity I
following O
the O
administration O
of O
local O
anesthetics O
is O
a O
recognized O
complication O
of O
regional O
anesthesia. O
Levobupivacaine, O
the O
pure O
S(-) O
enantiomer O
of O
bupivacaine, O
was O
developed O
to O
improve O
the O
cardiac O
safety O
profile O
of O
bupivacaine. O
We O
describe O
2 O
cases O
of O
grand B
mal I
seizures B
following O
accidental O
intravascular O
injection O
of O
levobupivacaine. O
CASE O
REPORT: O
Two O
patients O
presenting O
for O
elective O
orthopedic O
surgery O
of O
the O
lower O
limb O
underwent O
blockade O
of O
the O
lumbar O
plexus O
via O
the O
posterior O
approach. O
Immediately O
after O
the O
administration O
of O
levobupivacaine O
0.5% O
with O
epinephrine O
2.5 O
microgram/mL, O
the O
patients O
developed O
grand O
mal O
seizures, O
despite O
negative O
aspiration O
for O
blood O
and O
no O
clinical O
signs O
of O
intravenous O
epinephrine O
administration. O
The O
seizures O
were O
successfully O
treated O
with O
sodium O
thiopental O
in O
addition O
to O
succinylcholine O
in O
1 O
patient. O
Neither O
patient O
developed O
signs O
of O
cardiovascular B
toxicity. I
Both O
patients O
were O
treated O
preoperatively O
with O
beta-adrenergic O
antagonist O
medications, O
which O
may O
have O
masked O
the O
cardiovascular O
signs O
of O
the O
unintentional O
intravascular O
administration O
of O
levobupivacaine O
with O
epinephrine. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Although O
levobupivacaine O
may O
have O
a O
safer O
cardiac O
toxicity O
profile O
than O
racemic O
bupivacaine, O
if O
adequate O
amounts O
of O
levobupivacaine O
reach O
the O
circulation, O
it O
will O
result O
in O
convulsions. B
Plasma O
concentrations O
sufficient O
to O
result O
in O
central B
nervous I
system I
toxicity I
did O
not O
produce O
manifestations O
of O
cardiac O
toxicity O
in O
these O
2 O
patients. O

Anaesthetic O
complications O
associated O
with O
myotonia B
congenita: I
case O
study O
and O
comparison O
with O
other O
myotonic B
disorders. I

Myotonia B
congenita I
(MC) O
is B
caused O
by O
a O
defect O
in O
the O
skeletal O
muscle O
chloride O
channel O
function, O
which O
may O
cause O
sustained B
membrane I
depolarisation. I
We O
describe O
a O
previously O
healthy O
32-year-old O
woman O
who O
developed O
a O
life-threatening O
muscle B
spasm I
and O
secondary O
ventilation O
difficulties O
following O
a O
preoperative O
injection O
of O
suxamethonium. O
The O
muscle B
spasms I
disappeared O
spontaneously O
and O
the O
surgery O
proceeded O
without O
further O
problems. O
When O
subsequently O
questioned, O
she O
reported O
minor O
symptoms O
suggesting O
a O
myotonic B
condition. I
Myotonia O
was O
found O
on O
clinical O
examination O
and O
EMG. O
The O
diagnosis O
MC O
was O
confirmed O
genetically. O
Neither O
the O
patient O
nor O
the O
anaesthetist O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
before O
this O
potentially O
lethal O
complication O
occurred. O
We O

Respiratory O
pattern O
in O
a O
rat O
model O
of O
epilepsy. B

PURPOSE: O
Apnea B
is O
known O
to O
occur O
during O
seizures, B
but O
systematic O
studies O
of O
ictal O
respiratory O
changes O
in O
adults O
are O
few. O
Data O
regarding O
respiratory O
pattern O
defects O
during O
interictal O
periods O
also O
are O
scarce. O
Here O
we O
sought O
to O
generate O
information O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
interictal O
period O
in O
animals O
with O
pilocarpine-induced O
epilepsy. B
METHODS: O
Twelve O
rats O
(six O
chronically O
epileptic B
animals O
and O
six O
controls) O
were O
anesthetized, O
given O
tracheotomies, O
and O
subjected O
to O
hyperventilation B
or O
hypoventilation O
conditions. O
Breathing O
movements O
caused O
changes O
in O
thoracic O
volume O
and O
forced O
air O
to O
flow O
tidally O
through O
a O
pneumotachograph. O
This O
flow O
was O
measured O
by O
using O
a O
differential O
pressure O
transducer, O
passed O
through O
a O
polygraph, O
and O
from O
this O
to O
a O
computer O
with O
custom O
software O
that O
derived O
ventilation O
(VE), O
tidal O
volume O
(VT), O
inspiratory O
time O
(TI), O
expiratory O
time O
(TE), O
breathing O
frequency O
(f), O
and O
mean O
inspiratory O
flow O
(VT/TI) O
on O
a O
breath-by-breath O
basis. O
RESULTS: O
The O
hyperventilation O
maneuver O
caused O
a O
decrease O
in O
spontaneous O
ventilation O
in O
pilocarpine-treated O
and O
control O
rats. O
Although O
VE O
had O
a O
similar O
decrease O
in O
both O
groups, O
in O
the O
epileptic O
group, O
the O
decrease O
in O
VE O
was O
due O
to O
a O
significant O
(p O
< O
0.05) O
increase O
in O
TE O
peak O
in O
relation O
to O
that O
of O
the O
control O
animals. O
The O
hypoventilation O
maneuver O
led O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
arterial O
Paco2, O
followed O
by O
an O
increase O
in O
VE. O
In O
the O
epileptic O
group, O
the O
increase O
in O
VE O
was O
mediated O
by O
a O
significant O
(p O
< O
0.05) O
decrease O
in O
TE O
peak O
compared O
with O
the O
control O
group. O
Systemic O
application O
of O
KCN, O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effects O
of O
peripheral O
chemoreception O
activation O
on O
ventilation, O
led O
to O
a O
similar O
increase O
in O
VE O
for O
both O
groups. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
data O
indicate O
that O
pilocarpine-treated O
animals O
have O
an O
altered O
ability O
to O
react O
to O
(or O
compensate O
for) O
blood O
gas O
changes O
with O
changes O
in O
ventilation O
and O
suggest O
that O
it O
is O
centrally O
determined. O
We O
speculate O
on O
the O
possible O
relation O
of O
the O
current O
findings O
on O
treating O
different O
epilepsy-associated O
conditions. O

Increased O

in O
patients O
with O
acute B

due O
to O
paracetamol O
overdose. B

BACKGROUND/AIMS: O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
apoptosis O
via O
the O
Fas/Fas O
Ligand O
signaling O
system O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
acute B
liver I
failure. I
The O
aim O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
soluble O
form O
of O
Fas O
in O
patients O
with O
acute O
liver O
failure. O
METHODOLOGY: O
Serum O
levels O
of O
sFas O
(soluble O
Fas) O
were O
measured O
by O
ELISA O
in O
24 O
patients O
with O
acute O
liver O
failure O
and O
10 O
normal O
control O
subjects. O
Serum O
levels O
of O
tumor B
necrosis B
factor-alpha O
and O
interferon-gamma O
were O
also O
determined O
by O
ELISA. O
RESULTS: O
Serum O
sFas O
was O
significantly O
increased O
in O
patients O
with O
acute O
liver O
failure O
(median, O
26.8 O
U/mL; O
range, O
6.9-52.7 O
U/mL) O
compared O
to O
the O
normal O
controls O
(median, O
8.6 O
U/mL; O
range, O
6.5-12.0 O
U/mL, O
P O
< O
0.0001). O
Levels O
were O
significantly O
greater O
in O
patients O
with O
acute O
liver O

due O
to O
paracetamol O
overdose B
(median, O
28.7 O
U/mL; O
range, O
12.8-52.7 O
U/mL, O

than O
those O
due O

U/mL; O
range, O
6.9-46.0 O

7, O
P O
< O
0.01). O
There O
was O
no O
relationship O
of O
sFas O
to O
eventual O
outcome O
in O
the O
patients. O
A O
significant O
correlation O
was O
observed O
between O
serum O
sFas O
levels O
and O
aspartate O
aminotransferase O
(r O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
increased O
concentration O
of O
sFas O
in O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
acute O
liver O
failure O
may O
reflect O
activation O
of O
Fas-mediated O
apoptosis O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
this O
together O
with O
increased O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor-alpha O
may O
be O
an O
important O
factor O
in O

Bilateral O
subthalamic O
nucleus O
stimulation O
for O
Parkinson's B
disease. I

High O
frequency O
stimulation O
of O
the O
subthalamic O
nucleus O
(STN) O
is O
known O
to O
ameliorate O
the O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
advanced O
Parkinson's B
disease. I
AIM: O
We O
studied O
the O
effect O
of O
high O
frequency O
STN O
stimulation O
in O
23 O
patients. O
METHOD: O
Twenty-three O
patients O
suffering O
from O
severe O
Parkinson's O
disease O
(Stages O
III-V O
on O
Hoehn O
and O
Yahr O
scale) O
and, O
particularly O
bradykinesia, B
rigidity, B
and O
levodopa-induced O
dyskinesias B
underwent O
bilateral O
implantation O
of O
electrodes O
in O
the O
STN. O
Preoperative O
and O
postoperative O
assessments O
of O
these O
patients O
at O
1, O
3, O
6 O
and O
12 O
months O
follow-up, O
in O
"on" O
and O
"off" O

conditions, O
was O
carried O
out O
using O

staging, O
England O
activities O
of O
daily O
living O

and O
video O
recordings. O
RESULTS: O
After O
one O
year O
of O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
the O
STN, O
the O
patients' O
scores O
for O
activities O
of O
daily O

and O
motor O
examination O
scores O
(Unified O

off O
medication O
improved O
by O
62% O
and O
61% O
respectively O
(p<0.0005). O
The O
subscores O
for O
the O
akinesia, B
rigidity, O
tremor B
and O
gait O
also O
improved. O
(p<0.0005). O
The O
average O
levodopa O
dose O
decreased O
from O
813 O
mg O
to O
359 O
mg. O
The O
cognitive O
functions O
remained O
unchanged. O
Two O
patients O
developed O
device-related O
complications O
and O
two O
patients O
experienced O
abnormal O
weight O
gain. O
CONCLUSION: O
Bilateral O
subthalamic O
nucleus O
stimulation O
is O
an O
effective O
treatment O
for O
advanced O
Parkinson's O
disease. O
It O
reduces O
the O
severity O
of O
"off" O
phase O
symptoms, O
improves O
the O
axial O
symptoms O
and O
reduces O
levodopa O
requirements. O
The O
reduction O
in O
the O
levodopa O
dose O
is O
useful O
in O
controlling O
drug-induced B
dyskinesias. I

Ocular O
motility O
changes O
after O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
chemotherapy O
for O
retinoblastoma. B

BACKGROUND: O
Focal O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
injections O
have O
recently O
been O
used O
as O
a O
presumably O
toxicity-free B
adjunct O
to O
systemic O
chemotherapy O
for O
intraocular O
retinoblastoma. B
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
report O
our O
clinical O
experience O
with O
abnormal B
ocular I
motility I
in O
patients O
treated O
with O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
chemotherapy. O
METHODS: O
We O
noted O
abnormal O
ocular O
motility O
in O
10 O
consecutive O
patients O
with O
retinoblastoma O
who O
had O
received O
subtenon O
carboplatin. O
During O
ocular O
manipulation O
under O
general O
anesthesia, O
we O
assessed O
their O
eyes O
by O
forced O
duction O
testing, O
comparing O
ocular O
motility O
after O
tumor B
control O
with O
ocular O
motility O
at O
diagnosis. O
Eyes O
subsequently O
enucleated O
because O
of O
treatment O
failure O
(n O
= O
4) O
were O
examined O
histologically. O
RESULTS: O
Limitation O
of O
ocular O
motility O
was O
detected O
in O
all O
12 O
eyes O
of O
10 O
patients O
treated O
for O
intraocular O
retinoblastoma O
with O
1 O
to O
6 O
injections O
of O
subtenon O
carboplatin O
as O
part O
of O
multimodality O
therapy. O
Histopathological O
examination O
revealed O
many O
lipophages O
in O
the O
periorbital O
fat O
surrounding O
the O
optic O
nerve O
in O
1 O
eye, O
indicative O
of O
phagocytosis O
of O
previously O
existing O
fat O
cells O
and O
suggesting O
prior O
fat O
necrosis. B
The O
enucleations O
were O
technically O
difficult O
and O
hazardous O
for O
globe O
rupture B
because O
of O
extensive O
orbital O
soft O
tissue O
adhesions. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Subtenon O
carboplatin O
chemotherapy O
is O
associated O
with O
significant O
fibrosis B
of O
orbital O
soft O
tissues, O
leading O
to O
mechanical O
restriction O
of O
eye O
movements O
and O
making O
subsequent O
enucleation O
difficult. O
Subtenon O
carboplatin O
is O
not O
free O
of O
toxicity, O
and O
its O
use O
is O
best O
restricted O
to O
specific O
indications. O

Ethambutol O
and O
optic B
neuropathy. I

PURPOSE: O
To O
demonstrate O
the O
association O
between O
ethambutol O
and O
optic B
neuropathy. I
METHOD: O
Thirteen O
patients O
who O
developed O
optic O
neuropathy O
after O
being O
treated O
with O
ethambutol O
for O
tuberculosis B
of I
the I
lung I
or I
lymph I
node I
at O
Siriraj O
Hospital O
between O
1997 O
and O
2001 O
were O
retrospectively O
reviewed. O
The O
clinical O
characteristics O
and O
initial O
and O
final O
visual O
acuity O
were O
analyzed O
to O
determine O
visual O
outcome. O
RESULTS: O
All O
patients O
had O
optic O
neuropathy O
between O
1 O
to O
6 O
months O
(mean O
= O
2.9 O
months) O
after O
starting O
ethambutol O
therapy O
at O
a O
dosage O
ranging O
from O
13 O
to O
20 O
mg/kg/day O
(mean O
= O
17 O
mg/kg/day). O
Seven O
(54%) O
of O
the O
13 O
patients O
experienced O
visual O
recovery O
after O
stopping O
the O
drug. O
Of O
6 O
patients O
with O
irreversible O
visual B
impairment, I
4 O
patients O
had O
diabetes B
mellitus, I
glaucoma B
and O
a O
history O
of O
heavy O
smoking. O
CONCLUSION: O
Early O
recognition O
of O
optic O
neuropathy O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
patients O
with O
ethambutol O
therapy. O
A O
low O
dose O
and O
prompt O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
drug O
is O
recommended O
particularly O
in O
individuals O
with O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
glaucoma O
or O
who O
are O
heavy O
smokers. O

Treatment O
of O
compensatory O
gustatory B
hyperhidrosis I
with O
topical O
glycopyrrolate. O

Gustatory B
hyperhidrosis B
is O
facial O
sweating B
usually O
associated O
with O
the O
eating O
of O
hot O
spicy O
food O
or O
even O
smelling O
this O
food. O
Current O
options O
of O
treatment O
include O
oral O
anticholinergic O
drugs, O
the O
topical O
application O
of O
anticholinergics O
or O
aluminum O
chloride, O
and O
the O
injection O
of O
botulinum O
toxin. O
Thirteen O
patients O
have O
been O
treated O
to O
date O
with O
1.5% O
or O
2% O
topical O
glycopyrrolate. O
All O
patients O
had O
gustatory B
hyperhidrosis, I
which O
interfered O
with O
their O
social O
activities, O
after O
transthroacic O
endoscopic O
sympathectomy, O
and O
which O
was O
associated O
with O
compensatory O
focal O
hyperhidrosis. O
After O
applying O
topical O
glycopyrrolate, O
the O
subjective O
effect O
was O
excellent O
(no O
sweating O
after O
eating O
hot O
spicy O
food) O
in O
10 O
patients O
(77%), O
and O
fair O
(clearly O
reduced O
sweating) O
in O
3 O
patients O
(23%). O
All O
had O
reported O
incidents O
of O
being O
very O
embarrassed O
whilst O
eating O
hot O
spicy O
foods. O
Adverse O
effects O
included O
a O
mildly O
dry B
mouth I
and O
a O
sore B
throat I
in O
2 O
patients O
(2% O
glycopyrrolate), O
a O
light O
headache B
in O
1 O
patient O
(1.5% O
glycopyrrolate). O
The O
topical O
application O
of O
a O
glycopyrrolate O
pad O
appeared O
to O
be O
safe, O
efficacious, O
well O
tolerated, O
and O
a O
convenient O
method O
of O
treatment O
for O
moderate O
to O
severe O
symptoms O
of O
gustatory O
hyperhidrosis O
in O
post O
transthoracic O
endoscopic O
sympathectomy O
or O
sympathicotomy O
patients, O
with O
few O
side O
effects. O

We O
compared O
the O
pharmacokinetics, O
pharmacodynamics O
and O
safety O
profile O
of O
a O
new O
galenic O
formulation O
of O
propofol O
(AM149 O
1%), O
which O
does O
not O
contain O
soyabean O
oil, O
with O
a O
standard O
formulation O
of O
propofol O
(Disoprivan O
1%). O
In O
a O
randomised, O
double-blind, O
cross-over O
study, O
30 O
healthy O
volunteers O
received O
a O
single O
intravenous O
bolus O
injection O
of O
2.5 O
mg.kg-1 O
propofol. O
Plasma O
propofol O
levels O
were O
measured O
for O
48 O
h O
following O
drug O
administration O
and O
evaluated O
according O
to O
a O
three-compartment O
model. O
The O
pharmacodynamic O
parameters O
assessed O
included O
induction O
and O
emergence O
times, O
respiratory O
and O
cardiovascular O
effects, O
and O
pain B
on O
injection. O
Patients O
were O
monitored O
for O
side O
effects O
over O
48 O
h. O
Owing O
to O
a O
high O
incidence O
of O
thrombophlebitis, B
the O
study O
was O
terminated O
prematurely O
and O
only O
the O
data O
of O
the O
two O
parallel O
treatment O
groups O
(15 O
patients O
in O
each O
group) O
were O
analysed. O
Plasma O
concentrations O
did O
not O
differ O
significantly O
between O
the O
two O
formulations. O
Anaesthesia O
induction O
and O
emergence O
times, O
respiratory O
and O
cardiovascular O
variables O
showed O
no O
significant O
differences O
between O
the O
two O
treatment O
groups. O
Pain B
on O
injection O
(80 O
vs. O
20%, O
p O
< O
0.01) O
and O
thrombophlebitis O
(93.3 O
vs. O
6.6%, O
p O
< O
0.001) O
occurred O
more O
frequently O
with O
AM149 O
than O
with O
Disoprivan. O
Although O
both O
formulations O
had O
similar O
pharmacokinetic O
and O
pharmacodynamic O
profiles O
the O
new O
formulation O
is O
not O
suitable O
for O
clinical O
use O
due O
to O
the O
high O
incidence O
of O
thrombophlebitis O
produced. O

Several O
cases O
of O
cardiac O
adverse O
reactions O
related O
to O
vinorelbine O
(VNR) O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
literature. O
In O
order O
to O
quantify O
the O
incidence O
of O
these O
cardiac O
events, O
we O
performed O
a O
meta-analysis O
of O
clinical O
trials O
comparing O
VNR O
with O
other O
chemotherapeutic O
agents O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
various O
malignancies. B
Randomized O
clinical O
trials O
comparing O
VNR O
with O
other O
drugs O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
cancer B
were O
searched O
in O
Medline, O
Embase, O
Evidence-based O
Medicine O
Reviews O
databases O
and O
the O
Cochrane O
library O
from O
1987 O
to O
2002. O
Outcomes O
of O
interest O
were O
severe O
cardiac O
events, O
toxic O
deaths O
and O
cardiac O
event-related O
deaths O
reported O
in O
each O
publication. O
We O
found O
19 O
trials, O
involving O
2441 O
patients O
treated O
by O
VNR O
and O
2050 O
control O
patients. O
The O
incidence O
of O
cardiac O
events O
with O
VNR O
was O
1.19% O
[95% O
confidence O
interval O
(CI) O
(0.75; O
1.67)]. O
There O
was O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
risk O
of O
cardiac O
events O
between O
VNR O
and O
other O
drugs O
[odds O
ratio: O
0.92, O
95% O
CI O
(0.54; O
1.55)]. O
The O
risk O
of O
VNR O
cardiac O
events O
was O
similar O
to O
vindesine O
(VDS) O
and O
other O
cardiotoxic B
drugs O
[fluorouracil, O
anthracyclines, O
gemcitabine O
(GEM) O
em O
leader O
]. O
Even O
if O
it O
did O
not O
reach O
statistical O
significance O
because O
of O
a O
few O
number O
of O
cases, O
the O
risk O
was O
lower O
in O
trials O
excluding O
patients O
with O
cardiac O
history, O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
higher O
in O
trials O
including O
patients O
with O
pre-existing O
cardiac B
diseases. I
Vinorelbine-related O
cardiac O
events O
concern O
about O
1% O
of O
treated O
patients O
in O
clinical O
trials. O
However, O
the O
risk O
associated O
with O
VNR O
seems O
to O
be O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
other O
chemotherapeutic O
agents O
in O
the O
same O

PURPOSE: O
To O
determine O
the O
natural O
history O
of O
visual B
field I
defects I
in O
a O
group O
of O
patients O
known O
to O
have O
Vigabatrin-associated O
changes O
who O
elected O
to O
continue O
the O
medication O
because O
of O
good O
seizure B
control. O
METHODS: O
All O
patients O
taking O
Vigabatrin O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
antiepileptic O
drugs O
for O
at O
least O
5 O
years O
(range O
5-12 O
years) O
were O
entered O
into O
a O
visual O
surveillance O
programme. O
Patients O
were O
followed O
up O
at O
6-monthly O
intervals O
for O
not O
less O
than O
18 O
months O
(range O
18-43 O
months). O
In O
all, O
16 O
patients O
with O
unequivocal O
defects O
continued O
the O
medication. O
Following O
already O
published O
methodology O
(Eye O
2002; O
16;567-571) O
monocular O
mean O
radial O
degrees O
(MRDs) O
to O
the O
I/4e O
isopter O
on O
Goldmann O

was O
calculated O
for O
the O
right O
eye O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discovery O
of O
a O
visual O
field O
defect O
and O
again O
after O
not O
less O
than O
18 O
months O
follow-up. O
RESULTS: O
Mean O
right O
eye O
MRD O
at O
presentation O
was O
36.98 O
degrees O
(range O
22.25-51.0), O
compared O
to O
38.40 O
degrees O
(range O
22.5-49.75) O
after O
follow-up; O
P=0.338 O
unpaired O

Only O
one O
patient O
demonstrated O
a O
deterioration B
in I
visual I
field I
during O
the O
study O
period O
and O
discontinued O
treatment. O
CONCLUSION: O
Established O
visual O
field O
defects O
presumed O
to O
be O
due O
to O
Vigabatrin O
therapy O
did O
not O
usually O
progress O
in O
spite O
of O
continuing O
use O
of O
the O
medication. O
These O
data O
give O
support O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
Vigabatrin-associated O
visual O
field O
defects O
may O
be O
an O
idiosyncratic O
adverse O
drug O
reaction O
rather O
than O
dose-dependent O
toxicity. B

Induction O
of O
rosaceiform O
dermatitis B
during O
treatment O
of O
facial B
inflammatory I
dermatoses I
with O
tacrolimus O
ointment. O

BACKGROUND: O
Tacrolimus O
ointment O
is O
increasingly O
used O
for O
anti-inflammatory O
treatment O
of O
sensitive O
areas O
such O
as O
the O
face, O
and O
recent O
observations O
indicate O
that O
the O
treatment O
is O
effective O
in O
steroid-aggravated O
rosacea B
and O
perioral B
dermatitis. B
We O
report O
on O
rosaceiform O
dermatitis O
as O
a O
complication O
of O
treatment O
with O
tacrolimus O
ointment. O
OBSERVATIONS: O
Six O
adult O
patients O
with O
inflammatory B
facial I
dermatoses I
were O
treated O
with O
tacrolimus O
ointment O
because O
of O
the O
ineffectiveness O
of O
standard O
treatments. O
Within O
2 O
to O
3 O
weeks O
of O
initially O
effective O
and O
well-tolerated O
treatment, O
3 O
patients O
with O
a O
history O
of O
rosacea O
and O
1 O
with O
a O
history O
of O
acne B
experienced O
sudden O
worsening O
with O
pustular O
rosaceiform O
lesions. O
Biopsy O
revealed O
an O
abundance O
of O
Demodex O
mites O
in O
2 O
of O
these O
patients. O
In O
1 O
patient O
with O
eyelid O
eczema, B
rosaceiform O
periocular B
dermatitis I
gradually O
appeared O
after O
3 O
weeks O
of O
treatment. O
In O
1 O
patient O
with O
atopic B
dermatitis, I
telangiectatic O
and O
papular B
rosacea I
insidiously O
appeared O
after O
5 O
months O
of O
treatment. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
observations O
suggest O
that O
the O
spectrum O
of O
rosaceiform O
dermatitis O
as O
a O
complication O
of O
treatment O
with O
tacrolimus O
ointment O
is O
heterogeneous. O
A O
variety O
of O
factors, O
such O
as O
vasoactive O
properties O
of O
tacrolimus, O
proliferation O
of O
Demodex O
due O
to O
local O
immunosuppression, O
and O
the O
occlusive O
properties O
of O
the O
ointment, O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
observed O
phenomena. O
Future O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
identify O
individual O
risk O
factors. O

We O
visualize, O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
the O
profile O
of O
structural B
deficits I
in I
the I
human I
brain I
associated O
with O
chronic O
methamphetamine O
(MA) O
abuse. O
Studies O
of O
human O
subjects O
who O
have O
used O
MA O
chronically O
have O
revealed O
deficits O
in O
dopaminergic O
and O
serotonergic O
systems O
and O
cerebral O
metabolic B
abnormalities. I
Using O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
(MRI) O
and O
new O
computational O
brain-mapping O
techniques, O
we O
determined O
the O
pattern O
of O
structural O
brain O
alterations O
associated O
with O
chronic O
MA O
abuse O
in O
human O
subjects O
and O
related O
these O
deficits O
to O
cognitive B
impairment. I
We O
used O
high-resolution O
MRI O
and O
surface-based O
computational O
image O
analyses O
to O
map O
regional O
abnormalities B
in I
the I
cortex, I
hippocampus, I
white I
matter, I
and I
ventricles I
in O
22 O
human O
subjects O
who O
used O
MA O
and O
21 O
age-matched, O
healthy O
controls. O
Cortical O
maps O
revealed O
severe O
gray-matter O
deficits O
in O
the O
cingulate, O
limbic, O
and O
paralimbic O
cortices O
of O
MA O
abusers O
(averaging O
11.3% O
below O
control; O
p O
< O
0.05). O
On O
average, O
MA O
abusers O
had O
7.8% O
smaller O
hippocampal O
volumes O
than O
control O
subjects O
(p O
< O
0.01; O
left, O
p O
= O
0.01; O
right, O
p O
< O
0.05) O
and O
significant O
white-matter O
hypertrophy B
(7.0%; O
p O
< O
0.01). O
Hippocampal O
deficits O
were O
mapped O
and O
correlated O
with O
memory O
performance O
on O
a O
word-recall O
test O
(p O
< O
0.05). O
MRI-based O
maps O
suggest O
that O
chronic O
methamphetamine O
abuse O
causes O
a O
selective O
pattern O
of O
cerebral O
deterioration O
that O
contributes O
to O
impaired B
memory I
performance. I
MA O
may O
selectively O
damage O
the O
medial O
temporal O
lobe O
and, O
consistent O
with O
metabolic O
studies, O
the O
cingulate-limbic O
cortex, O
inducing O
neuroadaptation, O
neuropil O
reduction, O
or O
cell O
death. O
Prominent O
white-matter O
hypertrophy O
may O
result O
from O
altered O
myelination O
and O
adaptive O
glial O
changes, O
including O
gliosis B
secondary O
to O
neuronal B
damage. I
These O
brain O
substrates O
may O
help O
account O
for O
the O
symptoms O
of O
MA O
abuse, O
providing O
therapeutic O
targets O
for O
drug-induced O
brain B
injury. I

Amiodarone, O
an O
efficacious O
and O
widely O
used O
antiarrhythmic O
agent, O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
cause O
hepatotoxicity B
in O
some O
patients. O
To O
gain O
insight O
into O
the O
mechanism O
of O
this O
unwanted O
effect, O
mice O
were O
administered O
various O
doses O
of O
amiodarone O
and O
examined O
for O
changes O
in O
hepatic O
histology O
and O
gene O
regulation. O
Amiodarone O
induced O
hepatomegaly, B
hepatocyte O
microvesicular O
lipid O
accumulation, O
and O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
serum O
triglycerides O
and O
glucose. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
of O
hepatic O
RNA O
revealed O
a O
dose-dependent O
increase O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
a O
number O
of O
genes O
critical O
for O
fatty O
acid O
oxidation, O
lipoprotein O
assembly, O
and O
lipid O
transport. O
Many O
of O
these O
genes O
are O
regulated O
by O
the O
peroxisome O
proliferator-activated O
receptor-alpha O
(PPARalpha), O
a O
ligand-activated O
nuclear O
hormone O
receptor O
transcription O
factor. O
The O
absence O
of O
induction O
of O
these O
genes O
as O
well O
as O
hepatomegaly O
in O
PPARalpha O
knockout O
[PPARalpha-/-] O
mice O
indicated O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
amiodarone O
were O
dependent O
upon O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
functional O
PPARalpha O
gene. O
Compared O
to O
wild-type O
mice, O
treatment O
of O
PPARalpha-/- O
mice O
with O
amiodarone O
resulted O
in O
an O
increased O
rate O
and O
extent O
of O
total O
body O
weight B
loss. I
The O
inability O
of O
amiodarone O
to O
directly O
activate O
either O
human O
or O
mouse O
PPARalpha O
transiently O
expressed O
in O
human O
HepG2 O
hepatoma B
cells O
indicates O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
amiodarone O
on O
the O
function O
of O
this O
receptor O
were O
indirect. O
Based O
upon O
these O
results, O
we O
conclude O
that O
amiodarone O
disrupts O
hepatic O
lipid O
homeostasis O
and O
that O
the O
increased O
expression O
of O
PPARalpha O
target O
genes O
is O
secondary O
to O
this O
toxic O
effect. O
These O
results O
provide O
important O
new O
mechanistic O
information O
regarding O
the O
hepatotoxic O
effects O
of O
amiodarone O
and O
indicate O
that O
PPARalpha O
protects O
against O
amiodarone-induced O
hepatotoxicity. O

A O

Whilst O
using O

the O

The O

was O
not O
made O
straight O
away O
although O
on O

After O

Accurate O
patient O
history O
contributes O

a O
case O
study. O

This O
case O
study O
highlights O
the O
important O
contribution O
of O
nursing O
in O
obtaining O
an O
accurate O
health O
history. O
The O
case O
discussed O
herein O
initially O
appeared O
to O
be O
neurogenic B
diabetes I
insipidus I
(DI) O
secondary B
to O
a O
traumatic B
brain I
injury. I
The O
nursing O
staff, O
by O
reviewing O
the O
patient's O
health O
history O
with O
his O
family, O
discovered O
a O
history O
of O
polydipsia B
and O
long-standing O
lithium O
use. O
Lithium O
is O
implicated O
in O
drug-induced O
nephrogenic B
DI, I
and O
because O
the O
patient O
had O
not O
received O
lithium O
since O
being O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital, O
his O
treatment O
changed O
to O
focus O
on O
nephrogenic O
DI. O
By O
combining O
information O
from O
the O
patient O
history, O
the O
physical O
examination, O
and O
radiologic O
and O
laboratory O
studies, O
the O
critical O
care O
team O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
self-treating O
his O
lithium-induced O
nephrogenic O
DI O
and O
developed O
neurogenic B
DI I
secondary O
to O
brain B
trauma. I
Thus O
successful O
treatment O
required O
that O
nephrogenic O
and O
neurogenic O
DI O
be O
treated O
concomitantly. O

RATIONALE: O
5-Hydroxytryptamine, O
via O
stimulation O
of O
5-HT O
2C O
receptors, O
exerts O
a O
tonic O
inhibitory O
influence O
on O
dopaminergic O
neurotransmission, O
whereas O
activation O
of O
5-HT O
2A O
receptors O
enhances O
stimulated O
DAergic O
neurotransmission. O
The O
antidepressant O
trazodone O
is O
a O
5-HT O
2A/2C O
receptor O
antagonist. O
OBJECTIVES: O
To O
evaluate O
the O
effect O
of O
trazodone O
treatment O
on O
behaviors O
dependent O
on O
the O
functional O
status O
of O
the O
nigrostriatal O
DAergic O
system. O
METHODS: O
The O
effect O
of O
pretreatment O
with O
trazodone O
on O
dexamphetamine- O
and O
apomorphine-induced O
oral B
stereotypies, I
on O
catalepsy B
induced O
by O
haloperidol O
and O
apomorphine O
(0.05 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.), O
on O
ergometrine-induced O
wet O

(WDS) O
behavior O
and O
fluoxetine-induced O
penile O
erections O
was O
studied O
in O
rats. O
We O
also O
investigated O
whether O
trazodone O
induces O
catalepsy O
in O
rats. O
RESULTS: O
Trazodone O
at O
2.5-20 O
mg/kg O
i.p. O
did O
not O
induce O
catalepsy, O
and O
did O
not O
antagonize O
apomorphine O
(1.5 O
and O
3 O
mg/kg) O
stereotypy O
and O
apomorphine O
(0.05 O
mg/kg)-induced O
catalepsy. O
However, O
pretreatment O
with O
5, O
10 O
and O
20 O
mg/kg O
i.p. O
trazodone O
enhanced O
dexamphetamine O
stereotypy, O
and O
antagonized O
haloperidol O
catalepsy, O
ergometrine-induced O
WDS O
behavior O
and O
fluoxetine-induced O
penile O
erections. O
Trazodone O
at O
30, O
40 O
and O
50 O
mg/kg O
i.p. O
induced O
catalepsy O
and O
antagonized O
apomorphine O
and O
dexamphetamine O
stereotypies. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
trazodone O
at O
2.5-20 O
mg/kg O
does O
not O
block O
pre- O
and O
postsynaptic O
striatal O
D2 O
DA O
receptors, O
while O
at O
30, O
40 O
and O
50 O
mg/kg O
it O
blocks O
postsynaptic O
striatal O
D2 O
DA O
receptors. O
Furthermore, O
at O
5, O
10 O
and O
20 O
mg/kg, O
trazodone O
blocks O
5-HT O
2A O
and O
5-HT O
2C O
receptors. O
We O
suggest O
that O
trazodone O
(5, O
10 O
and O
20 O
mg/kg), O
by O
blocking O
the O
5-HT O
2C O
receptors, O
releases O
the O
nigrostriatal O
DAergic O
neurons O
from O
tonic O
inhibition O
caused O
by O
5-HT, O
and O
thereby O
potentiates O
dexamphetamine O
stereotypy O
and O
antagonizes O
haloperidol O
catalepsy. O

Swallowing B

many O
aspects O

have O
not O
been O
completely O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
oropharyngeal O
dynamics O
in O
PD O
patients O
with O

without O
levodopa-induced O
dyskinesia. B
Fifteen O
dyskinetic, B
12 O
nondyskinetic O
patients, O
and O
a O

were O
included. O
Patients O
were O
asked O
about O

evaluated O
with O
the O
Unified O

Disease I
Rating O
Scale O
Parts O
II O
and O
III O
and O
the O
Hoehn O

scale. O
Deglutition O
was O
assessed O
using O
modified O
barium O
swallow O
with O
videofluoroscopy. O
Nondyskinetic O
patients, O
but O
not O
the O
dyskinetic O
ones, O
showed O
less O
oropharyngeal O
swallowing O
efficiency O
(OPSE) O
for O
liquid O
food O
than O
controls O
(Dunnett, O
P O
= O
0.02). O
Dyskinetic B
patients O
tended O
to O
have O
a O
greater O
OPSE O
than O
nondyskinetic O
(Dunnett, O
P O
= O
0.06). O
Patients O
who O
were O
using O
a O
higher O
dose O
of O
levodopa O
had O
a O
greater O
OPSE O
and O
a O
trend O
toward O
a O
smaller O
oral O
transit O
time O
(Pearson's O
correlation, O
P O
= O
0.01 O
and O
0.08, O
respectively). O
Neither O
the O
report O
of O
dysphagia O
nor O
any O
of O
the O
PD O
severity O
parameters O
correlated O
to O
the O
videofluoroscopic O
variables. O
In O
the O
current O
study, O
dyskinetic O
patients O
performed O
better O
in O
swallowing O
function, O
which O
could O
be O
explained O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
greater O
levodopa O
dose. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
a O
role O
for O
levodopa O
in O
the O
oral O
phase O
of O
deglutition O
and O
confirm O
that O
dysphagia O
is O
not O
a O
good O
predictor O
of O
deglutition O
alterations O
in O
PD. O

30 O
days O
after O
these O
injections O

The O
results O
of O
the O
immunohistochemical O

determined O
by O
morphometry. O
RESULTS: O
Gentamicin-treated O
rats O
presented O
a O

The O
animals O

and O
stroke B
in O
people O
aged O
76 O
and O
older O
with O

DESIGN: O
A O
retrospective O
observational O
cohort O
study. O
SETTING: O
A O
major O
healthcare O
network O
involving O
four O
tertiary O
hospitals. O
PARTICIPANTS: O
Two O
hundred O
thirty-five O
patients O
aged O
76 O
and O
older O
admitted O
to O
a O
major O
healthcare O
network O
between O
July O
1, O
2001, O
and O
June O
30, O
2002, O
with O
atrial O

on O
warfarin O
were O
enrolled. O
MEASUREMENTS: O
Information O
regarding O
major O
bleeding B
episodes, O
strokes, B
and O
warfarin O
use O
was O
obtained O
from O
patients, O
relatives, O
primary O
physicians, O
and O
medical O
records. O
RESULTS: O
Two O
hundred O
twenty-eight O
patients O
(42% O
men) O
with O
a O
mean O
age O
of O
81.1 O
(range O
76-94) O
were O
included O
in O
the O
analysis. O
Total O
follow-up O
on O
warfarin O
was O
530 O
years O
(mean O
28 O
months). O
There O
were O
53 O
major O
hemorrhages, B
for O
an O
annual O
rate O
of O
10.0%, O
including O
24 O
(45.3%) O
life-threatening O
and O
five O
(9.4%) O
fatal O
bleeds. O
The O
annual O
stroke O
rate O
after O
initiation O
of O
warfarin O
was O
2.6%. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
rate O
of O
major O
hemorrhage O
was O
high O
in O
this O
old, O
frail O
group, O
but O
excluding O
fatalities, O
resulted O
in O
no O
long-term O
sequelae, O
and O
the O
stroke O
rate O
on O
warfarin O
was O
low, O

is. O

Safety O
of O
celecoxib O
in O
patients O
with O
adverse O

reactions I
to O
acetaminophen O
(paracetamol) O
and O
nimesulide O
associated O
or O
not O
with O
common O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs. O

BACKGROUND: O
Acetaminophen O
(paracetamol--P) O
and O
Nimesulide O
(N) O
are O
widely O
used O
analgesic-antipyretic/anti-inflammatory O
drugs. O
The O
rate O
of O
adverse O
hypersensitivity B
reactions O
to O
these O
agents O
is O
generally O
low. O
On O
the O
contrary O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAIDs) O
are O
commonly O
involved O
in O
such O
reactions. O
Celecoxib O
(CE) O
is O
a O
novel O
drug, O
with O
high O
selectivity O
and O
affinity O
for O
COX-2 O
enzyme. O
OBJECTIVE: O
We O
evaluated O
the O
tolerability O
of O
CE O
in O
a O
group O
of O
patients O
with O
documented O
history O
of O
adverse O
cutaneous B
reactions I
to O
P O
and O
N O
associated O
or O
not O
to O
classic O
NSAIDs. O
METHODS: O
We O
studied O
9 O
patients O
with O
hypersensitivity O
to O
P O
and O
N O
with O
or O
without O
associated O
reactions O
to O
classic O
NSAIDs. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
P O
and O
N-induced O
skin B
reactions I
was O
based O
in O
vivo O
challenge. O
The O
placebo O
was O
blindly O
administered O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
each O
challenge. O
After O
three O
days, O
a O
cumulative O
dosage O
of O
200 O
mg O
of O
CE O
in O
refracted O
doses O
were O
given. O
After O
2-3 O
days, O
a O
single O
dose O
of O
200 O
mg O
was O
administered. O
All O
patients O
were O
observed O
for O
6 O
hours O
after O
each O
challenge, O
and O
controlled O
again O
after O
24 O
hours O
to O
exclude O
delayed O
reactions. O
The O
challenge O
was O
considered O
positive O
if O
one O
or O
more O
of O
the O
following O
appeared: O
erythema, B
rush O
or O
urticaria-angioedema. B
RESULTS: B
No O
reaction O
was O
observed O
with O
placebo O
and O
eight O
patients O
(88.8%) O
tolerated O
CE. O
Only O
one O
patient O
developed O
a O
moderate O
angioedema O
of O
the O
lips. O
CONCLUSION: O
Only O
one O
hypersensitivity O
reaction O
to O
CE O
was O
documented O
among O
9 O
P O
and O
N-highly O
NSAIDs O
intolerant O
patients. O
Thus, O
we O
conclude O
that O
CE O
is O
a O
reasonably O
safe O
alternative O
to O
be O
used O
in O
subjects O
who O
do O
not O
tolerate O
P O
and O
N. O

Case-control O
study O
of O
regular O
analgesic O
and O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
use O
and O
end-stage B
renal I
disease. I

BACKGROUND: O
Studies O
on O
the O
association O
between O
the O
long-term O
use O
of O
aspirin O
and O
other O
analgesic O
and O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAIDs) O
and O
end-stage B
renal I
disease I
(ESRD) O
have B
given O
conflicting O
results. O
In O
order O
to O
examine O
this O
association, O
a O
case-control O
study O
with O
incident O
cases O
of O
ESRD O
was O
carried O
out. O
METHODS: O
The O
cases O
were O
all O
patients O
entering O
the O
local O
dialysis O
program O
because O
of O
ESRD O
in O
the O
study O
area O
between O
June O
1, O
1995 O
and O
November O
30, O
1997. O
They O
were O
classified O
according O
to O
the O
underlying O
disease, O
which O
had O
presumably O
led O
them O
to O
ESRD. O
Controls O
were O
patients O
admitted O
to O
the O
same O
hospitals O
from O
where O
the O
cases O
arose, O
also O
matched O
by O
age O
and O
sex. O
Odds O
ratios O
were O
calculated O
using O
a O
conditional O
logistic O
model, O
including O
potential O
confounding O
factors, O
both O
for O
the O
whole O
study O
population O
and O
for O
the O
various O
underlying O
diseases. O
RESULTS: O
Five O
hundred O
and O
eighty-three O
cases O
and O
1190 O
controls O
were O
included O
in O
the O
analysis. O
Long-term O
use O
of O
any O
analgesic O
was O
associated O
with O
an O
overall O
odds O
ratio O
of O
1.22 O
(95% O
CI, O
0.89-1.66). O
For O
specific O
groups O
of O
drugs, O
the O
risks O
were O
1.56 O
(1.05-2.30) O
for O
aspirin, O
1.03 O
(0.60-1.76) O
for O
pyrazolones, O
0.80 O
(0.39-1.63) O
for O
paracetamol, O
and O
0.94 O
(0.57-1.56) O
for O
nonaspirin O
NSAIDs. O
The O
risk O
of O
ESRD O
associated O
with O
aspirin O
was O
related O
to O
the O
cumulated O
dose O
and O
duration O
of O
use, O
and O
it O
was O
particularly O
high O
among O
the O
subset O
of O
patients O
with O
vascular O
nephropathy B
as O
underlying O
disease O
[2.35 O
(1.17-4.72)]. O
CONCLUSION: O
Our O
data O
indicate O
that O
long-term O
use O
of O
nonaspirin O
analgesic O
drugs O
and O
NSAIDs O
is O
not O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
ESRD. O
However, O
the O
chronic O
use O
of O
aspirin O
may O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
ESRD. O

Two O

respectively, O
are O
reported. O
In O
both O
cases, O
QT B

noted. O
The O

Growth-associated O
protein O
43 O
expression O
in O

PURPOSE: O
GAP43 O
has O
been O
thought O
to O
be O
linked O
with O
mossy O
fiber O
sprouting O
(MFS) O
in O
various O
experimental O
models O
of O
epilepsy. B
To O
investigate O
how O
GAP43 O
expression O
(GAP43-ir) O
correlates O
with O
MFS, O
we O
assessed O
the O
intensity O
(densitometry) O
and O
extension O
(width) O
of O
GAP43-ir O
in O
the O
inner O
molecular O
layer O
of O
the O
dentate O
gyrus O
(IML) O
of O
rats O
subject O
to O
status B
epilepticus I
induced O
by O
pilocarpine O
(Pilo), O
previously O
injected O
or O
not O
with O
cycloheximide O
(CHX), O
which O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
inhibit O
MFS. O
METHODS: O
CHX O
was O
injected O
before O
the O
Pilo O
injection O
in O
adult O
Wistar O
rats. O
The O
Pilo O
group O
was O
injected O
with O
the O
same O
drugs, O
except O
for O
CHX. O
Animals O
were O
killed O
between O
30 O
and O
60 O
days O
later, O
and O
brain O
sections O
were O
processed O
for O
GAP43 O
immunohistochemistry. O
RESULTS: O
Densitometry O
showed O
no O
significant O
difference O
regarding O
GAP43-ir O
in O
the O
IML O
between O
Pilo, O
CHX+Pilo, O
and O
control O
groups. O
However, O
the O
results O
of O
the O
width O
of O
the O
GAP43-ir O
band O
in O
the O
IML O
showed O
that O
CHX+Pilo O
and O
control O
animals O
had O
a O
significantly O
larger O
band O
(p O
= O
0.03) O
as O
compared O
with O
that O
in O
the O
Pilo O
group. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
current O
finding O
that O
animals O
in O
the O
CHX+Pilo O
group O
have O
a O
GAP43-ir O
band O
in O
the O
IML, O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
controls, O
reinforces O
prior O
data O
on O
the O
blockade O
of O
MFS O
in O
these O
animals. O
The O
change O
in O
GAP43-ir O
present O
in O
Pilo-treated O
animals O
was O
a O
thinning O
of O
the O
band O
to O
a O
very O
narrow O
layer O
just O
above O
the O
granule O
cell O
layer O
that O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
loss O
of O
hilar O
cell O
projections O
that O
express O
GAP-43. O

RATIONALE: O
Nicotine O
and O
caffeine O
are O
widely O
consumed O
licit O
psychoactive O
drugs O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
studies O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
generally O
used O
concurrently. O
Although O
some O
studies O
in O
experimental O
animals O
indicate O
clear O
pharmacological O
interactions O
between O
them, O
no O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
specific O
interaction O
on O
anxiety B
responses. O
OBJECTIVES: O
The O
present O
study O
investigates O
the O
effects O
of O
nicotine O
on O
anxiety O
induced O
by O
caffeine O
and O
another O
anxiogenic O
drug, O
pentylenetetrazole, O
in O
mice. O
The O
elevated O
plus-maze O
(EPM) O
test O
was O
used O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effects O
of O
drugs O
on O
anxiety. O
METHODS: O
Adult O
male O
Swiss O
Webster O
mice O
(25-32 O
g) O
were O
given O
nicotine O
(0.05-0.25 O
mg/kg O
s.c.) O
or O
saline O
10 O
min O
before O
caffeine O
(70 O
mg/kg O
i.p.) O
or O
pentylenetetrazole O
(15 O
and O
30 O
mg/kg O
i.p.) O
injections. O
After O
15 O
min, O
mice O
were O
evaluated O
for O
their O
open- O
and O
closed-arm O
time O
and O
entries O
on O
the O
EPM O
for O
a O
10-min O
session. O
Locomotor O
activity O
was O
recorded O
for O
individual O
groups O
by O
using O
the O
same O
treatment O
protocol O
with O
the O
EPM O
test. O
RESULTS: O
Nicotine O
(0.05-0.25 O
mg/kg) O
itself O
did O
not O
produce O
any O
significant O
effect O
in O
the O
EPM O
test, O
whereas O
caffeine O
(70 O
mg/kg) O
and O
pentylenetetrazole O
(30 O
mg/kg) O
produced O
an O
anxiogenic O
effect, O
apparent O
with O
decreases O
in O
open-arm O
time O
and O
entry. O
Nicotine O
(0.25 O
mg/kg) O
pretreatment O
blocked O
the O
caffeine- O
but O
not O
pentylenetetrazole-induced O
anxiety. O
Administration O
of O
each O
drug O
and O
their O
combinations O
did O
not O
produce O
any O
effect O
on O
locomotor O
activity. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
antagonistic O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
on O
caffeine-induced O
anxiety O
is O
specific O
to O
caffeine, O
instead O
of O
a O
non-specific O
anxiolytic O
effect. O
Thus, O
it O
may O
extend O
the O
current O
findings O
on O
the O
interaction O
between O
nicotine O
and O
caffeine. O

DATA O
COLLECTION O
AND O
ANALYSIS: O
Fifteen O
RCTs O
were O
included. O
Trials O
were O

MAIN O
RESULTS: O
All O
the O
statistically O
significant O
results O
were O
derived O
from O
the O
two O
biggest O
trials. O
In O
relatively O
healthy O
women, O
combined O
continuous O
HT O
significantly O
increased O
the O
risk O
of O
venous O

year's O
use), O
stroke O
(after O

(after O
5 O
years) O
and O
gallbladder O
disease. O
Long-term O
oestrogen-only O
HT O
also O
significantly O
increased O
the O
risk O
of O
stroke O
and O
gallbladder O
disease. O
Overall, O
the O
only O
statistically O
significant O
benefits O
of O
HT O
were O
a O
decreased O
incidence O
of O

with O
long-term O
use. O
Among O
relatively O
healthy O
women O
over O
65 O
years O
taking O
continuous O
combined O
HT, O
there O
was O
a O
statistically O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
incidence O
of O

Among O
women O
with O
cardiovascular O
disease, O
long-term O
use O
of O
combined O
continuous O
HT O
significantly O
increased O
the O
risk O
of O
venous O

However, O
one O

METHODS: O
A O
cooperative O
network O
was O
created O
in O
1994 O
in O
Spain O
to O
identify O
all O
suspicions O
of O
DILI O
following O
a O
prospective O
structured O

form. O
The O
liver B

was O
characterized O
according O
to O
hepatocellular, O
cholestatic, B
and O
mixed O
laboratory O
criteria O
and O
to O
histologic O
criteria O
when O
available. O
Further O
evaluation O
of O
causality O

was O
centrally O
performed. O
RESULTS: O
Since O
April O
1994 O
to O
August O
2004, O
461 O
out O
of O
570 O
submitted O
cases, O
involving O
505 O
drugs, O
were O
deemed O
to O
be O
related O
to O
DILI. O
The O
antiinfective O
group O
of O
drugs O
was O
the O
more O
frequently O
incriminated, O
amoxicillin-clavulanate O
accounting O
for O
the O
12.8% O
of O
the O
whole O
series. O
The O
hepatocellular O
pattern O
of O
damage O
was O
the O
most O
common O
(58%), O
was O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
age O
(P O
< O
.0001), O
and O
had O
the O
worst O
outcome O
(Cox O
regression, O
P O
< O
.034). O
Indeed, O
the O
incidence O
of O
liver O
transplantation O
and O
death O
in O
this O
group O
was O
11.7% O
if O
patients O
had O
jaundice B
at O
presentation, O
whereas O
the O
corresponding O
figure O
was O
3.8% O
in O
nonjaundiced O
patients O
(P O
< O
.04). O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Patients O
with O
drug-induced O

have O
11.7% O
chance O
of O

The O
aims O
of O
this O
study O
were O
to O
examine O
vancomycin O
(VCM)-induced O
oxidative O
stress O
that O
promotes O
production O
of O

the O
role O

has O
also O
antioxidant O
properties, O
on O
kidney O
tissue O
against O
the O
possible O
VCM-induced O
renal B

in O
rats. O
Rats O
were O
divided O
into O
three O
groups: O
sham, O
VCM O
and O
VCM O
plus O
erdosteine. O
VCM O
was O
administrated O
intraperitoneally O
(i.p.) O
with O
200mgkg(-1) O
twice O
daily O
for O
7 O
days. O
Erdosteine O
was O
administered O
orally. O
VCM O
administration O
to O
control O
rats O
significantly O
increased O
renal O
malondialdehyde O

and O
urinary O
N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase O
(NAG, O
a O
marker O
of O
renal B
tubular I
injury) I
excretion O
but O
decreased O
superoxide O
dismutase O
(SOD) O
and O
catalase O
(CAT) O
activities. O
Erdosteine O
administration O
with O
VCM O
injections O
caused O
significantly O
decreased O
renal O
MDA O
and O
urinary O
NAG O
excretion, O
and O
increased O
SOD O
activity, O
but O
not O
CAT O
activity O
in O
renal O
tissue O
when O
compared O
with O
VCM O
alone. O
Erdosteine O
showed O
histopathological O
protection O
against O
VCM-induced O
nephrotoxicity. B
There O
were O
a O
significant O
dilatation O
of O
tubular O
lumens, O
extensive O
epithelial O

in O
VCM-treated O
rats O
more O
than O
those O
of O
the O
control O
and O
the O
erdosteine O
groups. O
Erdosteine O
caused O
a O
marked O
reduction O
in O
the O
extent O
of O
tubular O
damage. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
oxidative O
tubular O
damage O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
VCM-induced O
nephrotoxicity O
and O
the O
modulation O
of O
oxidative O
stress O
with O
erdosteine O
reduces O
the O
VCM-induced O
kidney B
damage I
both O
at O
the O
biochemical O
and O
histological O
levels. O

Does O
domperidone O
potentiate O
mirtazapine-associated O
restless B
legs I
syndrome? I

There O
is O
now O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
a O
central O
role O
for O
the O
dopaminergic O
system O
in O
restless B
legs I
syndrome I
(RLS). O
For B
example, O
the O
symptoms O
of O
RLS O
can O
be O
dramatically O
improved O
by O
levodopa O
and O
dopamine O
agonists, O
whereas O
central O
dopamine O
D2 O
receptor O
antagonists O
can O
induce O
or O
aggravate O
RLS O
symptoms. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
there O
is O
no O
previous O
report O
regarding O
whether O
domperidone, O
a O
peripheral O
dopamine O
D2 O
receptor O
antagonist, O
can O
also O
induce O
or O
aggravate O
symptoms O
of O
RLS. O
Mirtazapine, O
the O
first O
noradrenergic O
and O
specific O
serotonergic O
antidepressant O
(NaSSA), O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
RLS O
in O
several O
recent O
publications. O
The O
authors O
report O
here O
a O
depressed O
patient O
comorbid O
with O
postprandial B
dyspepsia I
who O
developed O
RLS O
after O
mirtazapine O
had O
been O
added O
to O
his O
domperidone O
therapy. O
Our O
patient O
started O
to O
have O
symptoms O
of O
RLS O
only O
after O
he O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
mirtazapine, O
and O
his O
RLS O
symptoms O
resolved O
completely O
upon O
discontinuation O
of O
his O
mirtazapine. O
Such O
a O
temporal O
relationship O
between O
the O
use O
of O
mirtazapine O
and O
the O
symptoms O
of O
RLS O
in O
our O
patient O
did O
not O
support O
a O
potentiating O
effect O
of O
domperione O
on O
mirtazapine-associated O
RLS. O
However, O
physicians O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
possibility O
that O
mirtazapine O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
RLS O
in O
some O
individuals, O
especially O
those O
receiving O
concomitant O
dopamine O
D2 O
receptor O
antagonists. O

5-Fluorouracil O
cardiotoxicity B
induced O
by O
alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine. O

Cardiotoxicity B
is O
a O
rare O
complication O
occurring O
during O
5-fluorouracil O
(5-FU) O
treatment O
for O
malignancies. B
We O
herein O
report O
the O
case O
of O
a O
70-year-old O
man O
with O
5-FU-induced O
cardiotoxicity, B
in O
whom O
a O
high O
serum O
level O
of O
alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine O
(FBAL) O
was O
observed. O
The O
patient, O
who O
had O
unresectable O
colon B
cancer I
metastases O
to O
the O
liver O
and O
lung, O
was O
referred O
to O
us O
for O
chemotherapy O
from O
an O
affiliated O
hospital; O
he O
had O
no O
cardiac O
history. O
After O
admission, O
the O
patient O
received O
a O
continuous O
intravenous O
infusion O
of O
5-FU O
(1000 O
mg/day), O
during O
which O
precordial B
pain I
with O
right B
bundle I
branch I
block I
occurred O
concomitantly O
with O
a O
high O
serum O
FBAL O
concentration O
of O
1955 O
ng/ml. O
Both O
the O
precordial O
pain O
and O
the O
electrocardiographic O
changes O
disappeared O
spontaneously O
after O
the O
discontinuation O
of O
5-FU. O
As O
the O
precordial O
pain O
in O
this O
patient O
was O
considered O
to O
have O
been O
due O
to O
5-FU-induced O
cardiotoxicity, O
the O
administration O
of O
5-FU O
was O
abandoned. O
Instead, O
oral O
administration O
of O
S-1 O
(a O
derivative O
of O
5-FU), O
at O
200 O
mg/day O
twice O
a O
week, O
was O
instituted, O
because O
S-1 O
has O
a O
strong O
inhibitory O
effect O
on O
dihydropyrimidine O
dehydrogenase, O
which O
catalyzes O
the O
degradative O
of O
5-FU O
into O
FBAL. O
The O
serum O
FBAL O
concentration O
subsequently O
decreased O
to O
352 O
ng/ml, O
the O
same O
as O
the O
value O
measured O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
S-1 O
administration. O
Thereafter, O
no O
cardiac B
symptoms I
were O
observed. O
The O
patient O
achieved O
a O
partial O
response O
6 O
months O
after O
the O
initiation O
of O
the O
S-1 O
treatment. O
The O
experience O
of O
this O
case, O
together O
with O
a O
review O
of O
the O
literature, O
suggests O
that O
FBAL O
is O
related O
to O
5-FU-induced O
cardiotoxicity. O
S-1 O
may O
be O
administered O
safely O
to O
patients O
with O
5-FU-induced O
cardiotoxicity. O

The O
influence O
of O
the O
time O
interval O
between O
monoHER O
and O
doxorubicin O
administration O
on O
the O
protection O
against O
doxorubicin-induced O
cardiotoxicity B
in O
mice. O

PURPOSE: O
Despite O
its O
well-known O
cardiotoxicity, B
the O
anthracyclin O
doxorubicin O
(DOX) O
continues O
to O
be O
an O
effective O
and O
widely O
used O
chemotherapeutic O
agent. O
DOX-induced O
cardiac B
damage I
presumably O
results O
from O
the O
formation O
of O
free O
radicals O
by O
DOX. O
Reactive O
oxygen O
species O
particularly O
affect O
the O
cardiac O
myocytes O
because O
these O
cells O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
relatively O
poor O
antioxidant O
defense O
system. O
The O
semisynthetic O
flavonoid O
monohydroxyethylrutoside O
(monoHER) O
showed O
cardioprotection O
against O
DOX-induced O
cardiotoxicity O
through O
its O
radical O
scavenging O
and O
iron O
chelating O
properties. O
Because O
of O
the O
relatively O
short O
final O
half-life O
of O
monoHER O
(about O
30 O
min), O
it O
is O
expected O
that O
the O
time O
interval O
between O
monoHER O
and O
DOX O
might O
be O
of O
influence O
on O
the O
cardioprotective O
effect O
of O
monoHER. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
this O
possible O
effect. O
METHODS: O
Six O
groups O
of O
6 O
BALB/c O
mice O
were O
treated O
with O
saline, O
DOX O
alone O
or O
DOX O
(4 O
mg/kg O
i.v.) O
preceded O
by O
monoHER O
(500 O
mg/kg O
i.p.) O
with O
an O
interval O
of O
10, O
30, O
60 O
or O
120 O
min. O
After O
a O
6-week O
treatment O
period O
and O
additional O
observation O
for O
2 O
weeks, O
the O
mice O
were O
sacrificed. O
Their O
cardiac O
tissues O
were O
processed O
for O
light O
microscopy, O
after O
which O
cardiomyocyte B
damage I
was O
evaluated O
according O
to O
Billingham O
(in O
Cancer B
Treat O
Rep O
62(6):865-872, O
1978). O
Microscopic O
evaluation O
revealed O
that O
treatment O
with O
DOX O
alone O
induced O
significant O
cardiac O
damage O
in O
comparison O
to O
the O
saline O
control O
group O
(P<0.001). O
RESULTS: O
The O
number O
of O
damaged O
cardiomyocytes O
was O
9.6-fold O
(95% O
CI O
4.4-21.0) O
higher O
in O
mice O
treated O
with O
DOX O
alone O
than O
that O
in O
animals O
of O
the O
control O
group. O
The O
ratio O
of O
aberrant O
cardiomyocytes O
in O
mice O
treated O
with O
DOX O
preceded O
by O
monoHER O
and O
those O
in O
mice O
treated O
with O
saline O
ranged O
from O
1.6 O
to O
2.8 O
(mean O
2.2, O
95% O
CI O
1.2-4.1, O
P=0.019). O
The O
mean O
protective O
effect O
by O
adding O
monoHER O
before O
DOX O
led O
to O
a O
significant O
4.4-fold O
reduction O
(P<0.001, O
95% O
CI O
2.3-8.2) O
of O
abnormal O
cardiomyocytes. O
This O
protective O
effect O
did O
not O
depend O
on O
the O
time O
interval O
between O
monoHER O
and O
DOX O
administration O
(P=0.345). O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
in O
an O
outpatient O
clinical O
setting O
monoHER O
may O
be O
administered O
shortly O
before O
DOX. O

has O
attracted O
attention O
as O
an O
effective O
drug O
for O
atrial B
fibrillation I
(AF) O
and B
atrial B
flutter I
(AFL). O
However, B
serious O
adverse O
effects, O
including O
torsade B
de I

(Tdp), O
have B
been O
reported. O
METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
Adverse O
effects O
of O
Bpd O
requiring O
discontinuation O
of O
treatment O
were O
evaluated. O
Bpd O
was O
administered O
to O
459 O
patients O
(361 O
males, O
63+/-12 O
years O
old) O
comprising O
378 O
AF O
and O
81 O
AFL O
cases. O
Mean O
left O
ventricular O
ejection O
fraction O
and O
atrial O
dimension O
(LAD) O
were O
66+/-11% O
and O
40+/-6 O
mm, O
respectively. O
Adverse O
effects O
were O
observed O
in O
19 O
patients O
(4%) O
during O
an O
average O
follow-up O
of O
20 O
months. O
There O
was O
marked O
QT B
prolongation I
greater O
than O
0.55 O

in O
13 O
patients, O
bradycardia B
less O
than O
40 O
beats/min O
in O
6 O
patients, O
dizziness B
and O
general O
fatigue B
in O
1 O
patient O
each. O
In O
4 O
of O
13 O
patients O
with O
QT O
prolongation, O
Tdp O
occurred. O
The O
major O
triggering O
factors O
of O
Tdp O
were O
hypokalemia B
and O
sudden O
decrease O
in O
heart O
rate. O
There O
were O
no O
differences O
in O
the O
clinical O
backgrounds O
of O
the O
patients O
with O

Tdp O
other O
than O
LAD O
and O
age, O
which O
were O
larger O
and O
older O
in O
the O
patients O
with O
Tdp. O
CONCLUSION: O
Careful O
observation O
of O
serum O
potassium O
concentration O
and O
the O
ECG O
should O
always O
be O
done O
during O
Bpd O
administration, O

AIM: O
Extrapyramidal B

is B
most O
commonly O
affected O
by O
typical O
antipsychotic O
drugs O
that O
have O
a O
high O

Recently, O

reported O
on O
the O

between O
the O
genetic O
variations O
in O
the O
DRD2 O

and O
the O

as O
a O

In O
this O

we O
evaluate O
the O

in O

The O

CONCLUSION: O
Our O
results O
did O
not O
lend O
strong O

in O

Physical O
training O
decreases O
susceptibility O
to O
subsequent O
pilocarpine-induced O
seizures B
in O
the O
rat. O

Regular O
motor O
activity O
has O
many O
benefits O
for O
mental O
and O
physical O
condition O
but O
its O
implications O
for O
epilepsy B
are O
still O
controversial. O
In O
order O
to O
elucidate O
this O
problem, O
we O
have O
studied O
the O
effect O
of O
long-term O
physical O
activity O
on O
susceptibility O
to O
subsequent O
seizures. B
Male O
Wistar O
rats O
were O
subjected O
to O
repeated O
training O
sessions O
in O
a O
treadmill O
and O
swimming O
pool. O
Thereafter, O
seizures O
were O
induced O
by O
pilocarpine O
injections O
in O
trained O
and O
non-trained O
control O
groups. O
During O
the O
acute O
period O
of O
status B
epilepticus, I
we O
measured: O
(1) O
the O
latency O
of O
the O
first O
motor O
sign, O
(2) O
the O
intensity O
of O
seizures, O
(3) O
the O
time O
when O
it O
occurred O
within O
the O
6-h O
observation O
period, O
and O
(4) O
the O
time O
when O
the O
acute O
period O
ended. O
All O
these O
behavioral O
parameters O
showed O
statistically O
significant O
changes O
suggesting O
that O
regular O
physical O
exercises O
decrease O
susceptibility O
to O
subsequently O
induced O
seizures O
and O
ameliorate O
the O
course O
of O
experimentally O
induced O
status O

Tonic O
dopaminergic O
stimulation O
impairs B
associative I
learning I
in O
healthy O
subjects. O

Endogenous O
dopamine O
plays O
a O
central O
role O
in O
salience O
coding O
during O
associative O
learning. O
Administration O
of O
the O
dopamine O
precursor O
levodopa O
enhances O
learning O
in O
healthy O
subjects O
and O
stroke B
patients. O
Because O
levodopa O
increases O
both O
phasic O
and O
tonic O
dopaminergic O
neurotransmission, O
the O
critical O
mechanism O
mediating O
the O
enhancement O
of O
learning O
is O
unresolved. O
We O
here O
probed O
how O
selective O
tonic O
dopaminergic O
stimulation O
affects O
associative O
learning. O
Forty O
healthy O
subjects O
were O
trained O
in O
a O
novel O
vocabulary O
of O
45 O
concrete O
nouns O
over O
the O
course O
of O
5 O
consecutive O
training O
days O
in O
a O
prospective, O
randomized, O
double-blind, O
placebo-controlled O
design. O
Subjects O
received O
the O
tonically O
stimulating O
dopamine-receptor O
agonist O
pergolide O
(0.1 O
mg) O
vs O
placebo O
120 O
min O
before O
training O
on O
each O
training O
day. O
The O
dopamine O
agonist O
significantly O
impaired B
novel I
word I
learning I
compared O
to O
placebo. O
This O
learning O
decrement O
persisted O
up O
to O
the O
last O
follow-up O
4 O
weeks O
post-training. O
Subjects O
treated O
with O
pergolide O
also O
showed O
restricted O
emotional O
responses O
compared O
to O
the O
PLACEBO O
group. O
The O
extent O
of O
'flattened' O
affect O
with O
pergolide O
was O
related O
to O
the O
degree O
of O
learning O
inhibition. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
tonic O
occupation O
of O
dopamine O
receptors O
impairs O
learning O
by O
competition O
with O
phasic O
dopamine O
signals. O
Thus, O
phasic O
signaling O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
critical O
mechanism O
by O
which O
dopamine O
enhances O
associative O
learning O
in O
healthy O
subjects O
and O
stroke O
patients. O

Chinese O
herbal O
medicine O
preparations O
are O
widely O
available O
and O
often O
regarded O
by O
the O
public O
as O
natural O
and O
safe O
remedies O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
medical O
conditions. O
Nephropathy B
caused O
by O
Chinese O
herbs O
has O
previously O
been O
reported, O
usually O
involving O
the O
use O
of O
aristolochic O
acids. O
We O
report O
a O
23-year-old O
woman O
who O
developed O
acute B
renal B
failure I
following O
prolonged O
use O
of O
a O
proprietary O
Chinese O
herbal O
slimming O
pill O
that O
contained O
anthraquinone O
derivatives, O
extracted O
from O
Rhizoma O
Rhei O
(rhubarb). O
The O
renal B
injury I
was O
probably O
aggravated O
by O
the O
concomitant O
intake O
of O
a O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drug, O
diclofenac. O
Renal O
pathology O
was O
that O
of O
hypocellular O
interstitial O
fibrosis. B
Spontaneous O
renal O
recovery O
occurred O
upon O
cessation O
of O
the O
slimming O
pills, O
but O
mild O
interstitial O
fibrosis O
and O
tubular O
atrophy B
was O
still O
evident O
histologically O
4 O
months O
later. O
Although O
a O
causal O
relationship O
between O
the O
use O
of O
an O
anthraquinone-containing O
herbal O
agent O
and O
renal O
injury O
remains O
to O
be O
proven, O
phytotherapy-associated O
interstitial O
nephropathy B
should O
be O
considered O
in O
patients O
who O
present O
with O
unexplained O
renal O
failure. O

Chloroacetaldehyde O
as O
a O
sulfhydryl O
reagent: O
the O
role O
of O
critical O
thiol O
groups O
in O
ifosfamide O
nephropathy. B

Chloroacetaldehyde O
(CAA) O
is O
a O
metabolite O
of O
the O
alkylating O
agent O
ifosfamide O
(IFO) O
and O
putatively O
responsible O
for O
renal B
damage I
following O
anti-tumor O
therapy B
with O
IFO. O
Depletion O
of O
sulfhydryl O
(SH) O
groups O
has O
been O
reported O
from O
cell O
culture, O
animal O
and O
clinical O
studies. O
In O
this O
work O
the O
effect O
of O
CAA O
on O
human O
proximal O
tubule O
cells O
in O
primary O
culture O
(hRPTEC) O
was O
investigated. O
Toxicity B
of O
CAA O
was O
determined O
by O
protein O
content, O
cell O
number, O
LDH O
release, O
trypan O
blue O
exclusion O
assay O
and O
caspase-3 O
activity. O
Free O
thiols O
were O
measured O
by O
the O
method O
of O
Ellman. O
CAA O
reduced O
hRPTEC O
cell O
number O
and O
protein, O
induced O
a O
loss O
in O
free O
intracellular O
thiols O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
necrosis B
markers. O
CAA O
but O
not O
acrolein O
inhibited O
the O
cysteine O
proteases O
caspase-3, O
caspase-8 O
and O
cathepsin O
B. O
Caspase O
activation O
by O
cisplatin O
was O
inhibited O
by O
CAA. O
In O
cells O
stained O
with O
fluorescent O
dyes O
targeting O
lysosomes, O
CAA O
induced O
an O
increase O
in O
lysosomal O
size O
and O
lysosomal O
leakage. O
The O
effects O
of O
CAA O
on O
cysteine O
protease O
activities O
and O
thiols O
could O
be O
reproduced O
in O
cell O
lysate. O
Acidification, O
which O
slowed O
the O
reaction O
of O
CAA O
with O
thiol O
donors, O
could O
also O
attenuate O
effects O
of O
CAA O
on O
necrosis O
markers, O
thiol O
depletion O
and O
cysteine O
protease O
inhibition O
in O
living O
cells. O
Thus, O
CAA O
directly O
reacts O
with O
cellular O
protein O
and O
non-protein O
thiols, O
mediating O
its O
toxicity B
on O
hRPTEC. O
This O
effect O
can O
be O
reduced O
by O
acidification. O
Therefore, O
urinary O
acidification O
could O
be O
an O
option O
to O
prevent O
IFO O
nephropathy B
in O
patients. O

Stereological O
methods O
reveal O
the O
robust O
size O
and O
stability O
of O
ectopic O
hilar O
granule O
cells O
after O
pilocarpine-induced O
status B
epilepticus I
in O
the O
adult O
rat. O

Following O
status B
epilepticus I
in O
the O
rat, O
dentate O
granule O
cell O
neurogenesis O
increases O
greatly, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
new O
neurons O
appear O
to O
develop O
ectopically, O
in O
the O
hilar O
region O
of O
the O
hippocampal O
formation. O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
ectopic O
hilar O
granule O
cells O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
spontaneous O
seizures B
that O
ultimately O
develop O
after O
status O
epilepticus. O
However, O
the O
population O
has O
never O
been O
quantified, O
so O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
it O
is O
substantial O
enough O
to O
have O
a O
strong O
influence O
on O
epileptogenesis. O
To O
quantify O
this O
population, O
the O
total O
number O
of O
ectopic O
hilar O
granule O
cells O
was O
estimated O
using O
unbiased O
stereology O
at O
different O
times O
after O
pilocarpine-induced O
status O
epilepticus. O
The O
number O
of O
hilar O
neurons O
immunoreactive O
for O
Prox-1, O
a O
granule-cell-specific O
marker, O
was O
estimated O
using O
the O
optical O
fractionator O
method. O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
size O
of O
the O
hilar O
ectopic O
granule O
cell O
population O
after O
status O
epilepticus O
is O
substantial, O
and O
stable O
over O
time. O
Interestingly, O
the O
size O
of O
the O
population O
appears O
to O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
frequency O
of O
behavioral O
seizures, O
because O
animals O
with O
more O
ectopic O
granule O
cells O
in O
the O
hilus O
have O
more O
frequent O
behavioral O
seizures. O
The O
hilar O
ectopic O
granule O
cell O
population O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
vary O
systematically O
across O
the O
septotemporal O
axis, O
although O
it O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
volume O
of O
the O
hilus. O
The O
results O
provide O
new O
insight O
into O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
ectopic O
hilar O
granule O
cells O
in O
the O
pilocarpine O
model O
of O
temporal B

epilepsy. I

A O

OBJECTIVE: O
Post-mortem O
studies O
have O
reported O
abnormalities O
of O
the O
cholinergic O
system O
in O
autism. B
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
assess O
the O
use O
of O
galantamine, O
an O
acetylcholinesterase O
inhibitor O
and O
nicotinic O
receptor O

in O
the O
treatment O
of O

METHODS: O
Thirteen O
medication-free O
children O

(mean O
age, O
8.8 O
+/- O
3.5 O
years) O
participated O
in O
a O
12-week, O

Overall, O
galantamine O
was O
well-tolerated, O
with O
no O

in O
one O
patient. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
this O
open O
trial, O
galantamine O
was O
well-tolerated O
and O
appeared O
to O
be O
beneficial O
for O
the O

with O
first-episode O
schizophrenia O
(75%), O
schizophreniform B
disorder I
(17%), O
or O
schizoaffective B
disorder I
(8%) O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
treatment O
with O
olanzapine O
(2.5-20 O
mg/day) O
or O
risperidone O
(1-6 O
mg/day). O
RESULTS: O
Response O
rates O
did O
not O
significantly O
differ O
between O

treatment, O
more O
subjects O
in O
the O

than O
with O
risperidone: O
the O
increase O
in O
weight O
at O

weight O
was O
17.3% O
(95% O
CI=14.2%-20.5%) O
with O
olanzapine O
and O
11.3% O
(95% O
CI=8.4%-14.3%) O
with O
risperidone. O
Body O
mass O
index O
at O
baseline O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Clinical O
outcomes O
with O
risperidone O
were O
equal O
to O
those O
with O
olanzapine, O
and O
response O
may O
be O
more O

Olanzapine O
may O
have O
an O
advantage O
for O

neo-adjuvant O
chemotherapy O
with O
epirubicin, O
paclitaxel O
(Taxol) O

and O
she O
had O
maintained O
a O
remarkably O
high O

activity. O
She O
was O
found O
to O

period. O
We O
discuss O
how O
evidence-based O
guidelines O
would O
not O
have O
been O
helpful O
in O
this O
case, O
and O
how O
chemotherapy O
can O
exhibit O
substantial O
cardiotoxicity B
that O
may O
develop O
over O
many O

We O
suggest O
that O
patients O
who O
have O
received O
chemotherapy O
at O
any O
time O
should O
have O
a O
pre-operative O
electrocardiogram O
even O

CONCLUSION: O
Among O
non-users O

naproxen O
seemed O
to O
carry O
the O
highest O

During O

penicillamine O
was O
interrupted O
after O
the O
appearance O

In O
our O
case O
the O

represented O
an O
effective O
treatment O
for O
a O
Wilson's O
disease O
patient O
in O
which O
penicillamine-related O

appeared. O
The O
safety O
of O
the O

Succimer O
chelation O

in O
lead-exposed O
rats O
but O
produces O
lasting O
cognitive B
impairment I
in O
the O
absence O
of O
lead O
exposure. O

BACKGROUND: O
There O
is O
growing O
pressure O
for O
clinicians O
to O
prescribe O
chelation O
therapy O
at O
only O
slightly O
elevated O
blood O
lead O
levels. O
However, O
very O
few O
studies O
have O
evaluated O
whether O
chelation O
improves O
cognitive B
outcomes O
in O
Pb-exposed O
children, O
or O
whether O
these O
agents O
have O
adverse O
effects O
that O
may O
affect O
brain O
development O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
Pb O
exposure. O
OBJECTIVES: O
The O
present O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
answer O
these O
questions, O
using O
a O
rodent O
model O
of O
early O
childhood O
Pb O
exposure O
and O
treatment O
with O
succimer, O
a O
widely O
used O
chelating O
agent O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
Pb B
poisoning. I
RESULTS: O
Pb O
exposure O
produced O
lasting O
impairments B
in I
learning, I
attention, I
inhibitory I
control, I
and I
arousal I
regulation, I
paralleling O
the O
areas O
of O
dysfunction O
seen O
in O
Pb-exposed O
children. O
Succimer O
treatment O
of O
the O
Pb-exposed O
rats O
significantly O
improved O
learning, O
attention, O
and O
arousal O
regulation, O
although O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
treatment O
varied O
as O
a O
function O
of O
the O
Pb O
exposure O
level O
and O
the O
specific O
functional O
deficit. O
In O
contrast, O
succimer O
treatment O
of O
rats O
not O
previously O
exposed O
to O
Pb O
produced O
lasting O
and O
pervasive O
cognitive B
and I
affective B
dysfunction I
comparable O
in O
magnitude O
to O
that O
produced O
by O
the O
higher O
Pb O
exposure O
regimen. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
are O
the O
first O
data, O
to O
our O
knowledge, O
to O
show O
that O
treatment O
with O
any O
chelating O
agent O
can O
alleviate O
cognitive B
deficits I
due O
to O
Pb O
exposure. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
it O
may O
be O
possible O
to O
identify O
a O
succimer O
treatment O
protocol O
that O
improves O
cognitive O
outcomes O
in O
Pb-exposed O
children. O
However, O
they O
also O
suggest O
that O
succimer O
treatment O
should O
be O
strongly O
discouraged O
for O
children O
who O
do O
not O
have O
elevated O
tissue O
levels O
of O
Pb O
or O
other O
heavy O
metals. O

The O
study O
aim O
was O
to O
identify O
these O

in O
a O
canine O

of O
acute O
heart B
failure. I
METHODS: O
Six O
dogs O
underwent O
MAP O
with O
a O
prosthetic O
band O
on O
the O
posterior O
mitral O
annulus, O
using O
four O
mattress O
sutures. O
The O
sutures O
were O
passed O
individually O
through O
four O
tourniquets O
and O
exteriorized O
untied O
via O
the O
left O
atriotomy. O
Sonomicrometry O
crystals O
were O
implanted O
around O
the O
mitral O
annulus O
and O
left O
ventricle O
to O
measure O
geometry O
and O
regional O
function. O
Acute O
heart O
failure O
was O
induced O
by O
propranolol O
and O
volume O
loading O
after O
weaning O
from O
cardiopulmonary O
bypass; O
an O
absence O
of O
MR O
was O
confirmed O
by O
echocardiography. O
MAP O
was O
accomplished O
by O
cinching O
the O
tourniquets. O
Data O
were O
acquired O
at O
baseline, O
after O
induction O
of O
acute O
heart O
failure, O
and O
after O
MAP. O
RESULTS: O
MAP O
decreased O
mitral O
annular O
dimensions O
in O
both O
commissure-commissure O
and O
septal-lateral O
directions. O
Concomitantly, O
the O
diastolic O
diameter O
of O
the O
LV O
base O
and O
LV O

decreased O
(i.e., O

+/- O
18.6% O
to O
65.3 O
+/- O
18.9% O
(p O
= O
0.016), O
respectively. O
Decreases O
were O
evident O
in O
both O

from O
7.7 O
+/- O
4.5% O
to O
9.4 O
+/- O
4.5% O
(p O

0.045). O
After O
MAP, O
increases O
were O
identified O
in O
both O

and O
Emax O
(from O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
data O
acquired O
suggest O
that O
isolated O
MAP O
may O
have O
certain O
benefits O
on O
LV O
dimension/function O
in O
acute O

even O
in O

should O
be O
considered O
in O
any O
uremic B
patients O
with O
unexplained O

CAPD O
is O
inefficient O
in O
removing O

Frequency O
of O
transient O
ipsilateral O

in O
patients O
undergoing O
carotid O
endarterectomy O
under O
local O
anesthesia. O

BACKGROUND: O
Especially O
because O
of O
improvements O
in O
clinical O
neurologic O
monitoring, O
carotid O
endarterectomy O
done O
under O
local O
anesthesia O
has O
become O
the O
technique O
of O
choice O
in O
several O
centers. O
Temporary O
ipsilateral O
vocal B
nerve I
palsies I
due O
to O
local O
anesthetics O
have O
been O
described, O
however. O
Such O
complications O
are O
most O
important O
in O
situations O
where O
there O
is O
a O
pre-existing O
contralateral O
paralysis. B
We O
therefore O
examined O
the O
effect O
of O
local O
anesthesia O
on O
vocal O
cord O
function O
to O
better O
understand O
its O
possible O
consequences. O
METHODS: O
This O
prospective O
study O
included O
28 O
patients O
undergoing O
carotid O
endarterectomy O
under O
local O
anesthesia. O
Vocal O
cord O
function O
was O
evaluated O
before, O
during, O
and O
after O
surgery O
(postoperative O
day O
1) O
using O
flexible O
laryngoscopy. O
Anesthesia O
was O
performed O
by O
injecting O
20 O
to O
40 O
mL O
of O
a O
mixture O
of O
long-acting O
(ropivacaine) O
and O
short-acting O
(prilocaine) O
anesthetic. O
RESULTS: O
All O
patients O
had O
normal O
vocal O
cord O
function O
preoperatively. O
Twelve O
patients O
(43%) O
were O
found O
to O
have O
intraoperative O
ipsilateral O
vocal B
cord I
paralysis. I
It O
resolved O
in O
all O
cases O
< O
or O
=24 O
hours. O
There O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
operating O
time O
or O
volume O
or O
frequency O
of O
anesthetic O
administration O
in O
patients O
with O
temporary O
vocal O
cord O
paralysis O
compared O
with O
those O
without. O
CONCLUSION: O
Local O
anesthesia O
led O
to O
temporary O
ipsilateral O
vocal O
cord O
paralysis O
in O
almost O
half O
of O
these O
patients. O
Because O
pre-existing O
paralysis O
is O
of O
a O
relevant O
frequency O
(up O
to O
3%), O
a O
preoperative O
evaluation O
of O
vocal O
cord O
function O
before O
carotid O
endarterectomy O
under O
local O
anesthesia O
is O
recommended O
to O
avoid O
intraoperative O
bilateral O
paralysis. O
In O
patients O
with O
preoperative O
contralateral O
vocal O
cord O
paralysis, O
surgery O
under O
general O
anesthesia O
should O
be O
considered. O

Cortical B
dysplasia I
is O
a O
malformation O
characterized O
by O
defects O
in O
proliferation, O
migration O
and O
maturation. O
This O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
evaluate O
the O
alterations O
in O
offspring O
rat O
cerebellum O
induced O
by O
maternal O
exposure O
to O
carmustine-[1,3-bis O
(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure] O
(BCNU) O
and O
to O
investigate O
the O
effects O
of O
exogenous O
melatonin O
upon O
cerebellar O
BCNU-induced O
cortical B
dysplasia, I
using O
histological O
and O
biochemical O
analyses. O
Pregnant O
Wistar O
rats O
were O
assigned O
to O
five O
groups: O
intact-control, O
saline-control, O
melatonin-treated, O
BCNU-exposed O
and O
BCNU-exposed O
plus O
melatonin. O
Rats O
were O
exposed O
to O
BCNU O
on O
embryonic O
day O
15 O
and O
melatonin O
was O
given O
until O
delivery. O
Immuno/histochemistry O
and O
electron O
microscopy O
were O
carried O
out O
on O
the O
offspring O
cerebellum, O
and O
levels O
of O
malondialdehyde O
and O
superoxide O
dismutase O
were O
determined. O
Histopathologically, O
typical O
findings O
were O
observed O
in O
the O
cerebella O
from O
the O
control O
groups, O
but O
the O
findings O
consistent O
with O
early O
embryonic O
development O
were O
noted O
in O
BCNU-exposed O
cortical O
dysplasia O
group. O
There O
was O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
TUNEL O
positive O
cells O
and O
nestin O
positive O
cells O
in O
BCNU-exposed O
group, O
but O
a O
decreased O
immunoreactivity O
to O
glial O
fibrillary O
acidic O
protein, O
synaptophysin O
and O
transforming O
growth O
factor O
beta1 O
was O
observed, O
indicating O
a O
delayed O
maturation, O
and O
melatonin O
significantly O
reversed O
these O
changes. O
Malondialdehyde O
level O
in O
BCNU-exposed O
group O
was O
higher O
than O
those O
in O
control O
groups O
and O
melatonin O
decreased O
malondialdehyde O
levels O
in O
BCNU O
group O
(P<0.01), O
while O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
superoxide O
dismutase O
levels O
between O
these O
groups. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
exposure O
of O
animals O
to O
BCNU O
during O
pregnancy O
leads O
to O
delayed O
maturation O
of O
offspring O
cerebellum O
and O
melatonin O
protects O
the O
cerebellum O
against O
the O
effects O
of O
BCNU. O

Lithium O
and O
valproate O
are O
the O
prototypic O
mood O
stabilizers O
and O
have O
diverse O
structures O
and O
targets. O
Both O
drugs O
influence O
inositol O
metabolism. O
Lithium O
inhibits O
IMPase O
and O
valproate O
inhibits O
MIP O
synthase. O
This O
study O
shows O
that O
MIP O
synthase O
inhibition O
does O
not O
replicate O
or O
augment O
the O
effects O
of O
lithium O
in O
the O
inositol O
sensitive O
pilocarpine-induced O
seizures B
model. O
This O
lack O
of O

may O
stem O
from O
the O
low O
contribution O
of O
de-novo O

Acute B
tubulo-interstitial I

is B
an O
important O
cause O
of O
acute B
renal I
failure I
resulting O
from O
a O
variety O
of O
insults, O
including O
immune O
complex-mediated O
tubulo-interstitial B
injury, I
but O
drugs O
such O
as O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAIDs) O
are O
a O
far O
more O
frequent O
cause. O
Overall, O
as O
an O
entity, O
ATIN O
remains O
under-diagnosed, O
as O
symptoms O
resolve O
spontaneously O
if O
the O
medication O
is O
stopped. O
We O
report O
on O
a O
14-year-old O
boy O
who O
developed O
acute O
renal O
failure O
2 O
weeks O
after O
aortic O
valve O
surgery. O
He O
was O
put O
on O
aspirin O
following O
surgery O
and O
took O
ibuprofen O
for O
fever B
for O
nearly O
a O
week O
prior O
to O
presentation. O
He O
then O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency O

feeling O
quite O
ill O
and O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O

of O
of O
147 O
mg/dl, O
creatinine O
of O
15.3 O
mg/dl O
and O
serum O
potassium O
of O
8.7 O
mEq/l. O
Dialysis O
was O
immediately O
initiated. O
A O
kidney O
biopsy O
showed O
inflammatory O
infiltrate O
consistent O
with O
ATIN. O
However, O
in O
the O
tubular O
basement O
membrane O
(TBM), O
very O
intense O
granular O
deposits O
of O
polyclonal O
IgG O
and O
C3 O
were O
noted. O
He O
needed O
dialysis O
for O
2 O
weeks O
and O
was O
treated O
successfully O
with O
steroids O
for O
6 O
months. O
His O
renal O
recovery O
and O

took O
a O
year. O
In O
conclusion, O
this O
is O
a O

BACKGROUND: O
In O

BACKGROUND: O
Azathioprine O
is O
widely O
used O
as O
an O
immunosuppressive O
drug. O
The O
side O
effects O
of O
azathioprine O
include O
anemia, B
which O
has O
been O
attributed O
to O
bone O
marrow O
suppression. O
Alternatively, O
anemia O
could O
result O
from O
accelerated O
suicidal O
erythrocyte O
death O
or O
eryptosis, O
which O
is O
characterized O
by O
exposure O
of O
phosphatidylserine O
(PS) O
at O
the O
erythrocyte O
surface O
and O
by O
cell O
shrinkage. O
METHODS: O
The O
present O
experiments O
explored O
whether O
azathioprine O
influences O
eryptosis. O
According O
to O
annexin O
V O
binding, O
erythrocytes O
from O
patients O
indeed O
showed O
a O
significant O
increase O
of O
PS O
exposure O
within O
1 O
week O
of O
treatment O
with O
azathioprine. O
In O
a O
second O
series, O
cytosolic O
Ca2+ O
activity O
(Fluo3 O
fluorescence), O
cell O
volume O
(forward O
scatter), O
and O
PS-exposure O
(annexin O
V O
binding) O
were O
determined O
by O
FACS O
analysis O
in O
erythrocytes O
from O
healthy O
volunteers. O
RESULTS: O
Exposure O
to O
azathioprine O
(> O
or O
=2 O
microg/mL) O
for O
48 O
hours O
increased O
cytosolic O
Ca2+ O
activity O
and O
annexin O
V O
binding O
and O
decreased O
forward O
scatter. O
The O
effect O
of O
azathioprine O
on O
both O
annexin O
V O
binding O
and O
forward O
scatter O
was O
significantly O
blunted O
in O
the O
nominal O
absence O
of O
extracellular O
Ca2+. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Azathioprine O
triggers O
suicidal O
erythrocyte O
death, O
an O
effect O
presumably O
contributing O
to O
azathioprine-induced O
anemia. O

BACKGROUND: O
Spinal O
anaesthesia O
is O
widely O
employed O
in O
clinical O
practice O
but O
has O
the O
main O
drawback O
of O
post-spinal O

hypotension. B
Efforts O
must O
therefore O
continue O
to O
be O
made O
to O
obviate O
this O
setback O
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
evaluate O
the O
cardiovascular O
and O
respiratory O
changes O
during O
unilateral O
and O
conventional O
spinal O
anaesthesia. O
METHODS: O
With O
ethical O
approval, O
we O
studied O
74 O
American O

Anesthesiologists O
(ASA), O
physical O
status O
class O
1 O
and O
2 O
patients O
scheduled O
for O

Patients O
were O
randomly O
allocated O
into O
one O
of O
two O
groups: O
lateral O
and O
conventional O
spinal O
anaesthesia O
groups. O
In O
the O
lateral O
position O
with O

side O
down, O
patients O
recived O
10 O
mg O
(2mls) O
of O
0.5% O
hyperbaric O
bupivacaine O
through O
a O
25-gauge O
spinal O
needle. O
Patients O
in O
the O
unilateral O
group O
were O
maintained O
in O
the O
lateral O
position O
for O
15 O
minutes O
following O
spinal O
injection O
while O
those O
in O
the O
conventional O
group O
were O
turned O
supine O
immediately O
after O
injection. O
Blood O
pressure, O
heart O
rate, O
respiratory O
rate O
and O
oxygen O
saturation O
were O
monitored O
over O
1 O
hour. O
RESULTS: O
Three O
patients O
(8.1%) O
in O
the O
unilateral O
group O
and O
5 O
(13.5%) O
in O
the O
conventional O
group O
developed O
hypotension, O
P= O
0.71. O
Four O
(10.8%) O
patients O
in O
the O
conventional O
group O
and O
1 O
(2.7%) O
in O
the O
unilateral O
group, O
P= O
0.17 O
required O
epinephrine O
infusion O
to O
treat O
hypotension. O
Patients O
in O
the O
conventional O
group O
had O
statistically O
significant O
greater O
fall O
in O
the O
systolic O
blood O
pressures O
at O
15, O
30 O
and O
45 O
minutes O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
baseline O
(P= O
0.003, O
0.001 O
and O
0.004). O
The O
mean O
respiratory O
rate O
and O
oxygen O
saturations O
in O
the O
two O
groups O
were O
similar. O
CONCLUSION: O
Compared O
to O
conventional O
spinal O
anaesthesia, O
unilateral O
spinal O
anaesthesia O
was O
associated O
with O
fewer O
cardiovascular O
perturbations. O
Also, O
the O
type O
of O
spinal O
block O
instituted O
affected O
neither O
the O
respiratory O
rate O
nor O
the O
arterial O
oxygen O
saturation. O

CLE O
during O
treatment O
with O
thalidomide O
and O
up O

were O
analysed. O
Sural O
nerve O
SAP O
amplitude O
reduction O
> O
or O

was O
the O
criteria O
for O
discontinuing O
therapy. O
RESULTS: O
During O
treatment, O
11 O
patients O
showed O
a O
reduction O
in O
sural O
nerve O
SAP O
amplitude O
compared O
to O
baseline O
values O
(9 O
with O
a O

One O
patient O
showed O
no O
changes O
in O
SAP O

Five O
patients O
complained O
of O
paresthesias B
and O
leg O
cramps. B
After O
thalidomide O
treatment, O
sural O
SAP O

recovered O
in O
3 O
patients. O
At O
detection O
of O
reduction O
in O
sural O
nerve O
SAP O
amplitude, O
the O
median O
thalidomide O
cumulative O
dose O
was O
21.4 O
g. O
The O
threshold O
neurotoxic O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Sural O
nerve O
SAP O
amplitude O
reduction O
is O
a O
reliable O
and O
sensitive O
marker O
of O

Reported O
herein O
is O
an O
autopsy O
case O
of O
valvular B
heart I
disease, I
in O
a O
patient O
who O
developed O
a O
lung B
mass I
(1.5 O
cm O

and O
proteinuria B
(2.76 O
g/day) O
after O
treatment O
with O
amiodarone O
for O
a O
long O
time. O
The O
lung O
mass O
was O
highly O
suspected O
to O
be O
lung B
cancer I
on O
CT O
and O
positron O
emission O
tomography, O
but O
histologically O
the O
lesion O
was O
composed O
of O
lymphoplasmacytic O
infiltrates O
in O
alveolar O
walls O
and O
intra-alveolar O
accumulation O
of O
foamy O
macrophages O
containing O
characteristic O
myelinoid O
bodies, O
indicating O
that O
it O
was O
an O
amiodarone-related O
lesion. O
In O
addition, O
the O
lung O
tissue O
had O
unevenly O
distributed O
hemosiderin B
deposition, O
and O
abnormally O
tortuous O
capillaries O
were O
seen O
in O
the O
mass O
and O
in O
heavily O
hemosiderotic B
lung O
portions O
outside O
the O
mass. O
In O
the O
kidneys, O
glomeruli O
had O
membrane O
spikes, O
prominent O
swelling O
of O
podocytes O
and O
subepithelial O
deposits, O
which O
were O
sometimes O
large O

not O
found. O
The O
present O

highlights O
the O
possibility O
that O
differential O
diagnosis O
between O
an O
amiodarone-related O
pulmonary B
lesion I
and O
a O

can O
be O
very O
difficult O
radiologically, O
and O
suggests O
that O

might O
be O
another O
possible O
complication O
of O

RESULTS: O
The O
76 O

The O
hazard O
of O
developing O
CAD O
(95% O

increased O
by O
2.4-fold O
(1.3-4.3, O

with O
either. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Initiating O
treatment O
of O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
with O
glibenclamide O
or O
glipizide O
is O
associated O
with O
increased O
risk O
of O
CAD O
in O
comparison O
to O
gliclazide O
or O

If O
confirmed, O
this O
may O
be O
important O
because O
most O
Indian O
patients O
receive O
the O
cheaper O
older O
sulphonylureas, O
and O
present O
guidelines O
do O
not O
distinguish O
between O

BACKGROUND: O
Our O
aim O
was O
to O
investigate O
postoperative O
complications O
and O
mortality O
after O
administration O
of O
aprotinin O
compared O
to O
tranexamic O
acid O
in O
an O
unselected, O
consecutive O
cohort. O
METHODS: O
Perioperative O
data O
from O
consecutive O
cardiac O
surgery O
patients O
were O
prospectively O
collected O
between O
September O
2005 O
and O
June O
2006 O
in O
a O
university-affiliated O
clinic O
(n O
= O
1188). O
During O
the O
first O
5 O
mo, O
596 O
patients O
received O
aprotinin O
(Group O
A); O
in O
the O
next O
5 O
mo, O
592 O
patients O
were O
treated O
with O
tranexamic O
acid O
(Group O
T). O
Except O
for O
antifibrinolytic O
therapy, O
the O
anesthetic O
and O
surgical O
protocols O
remained O
unchanged. O
RESULTS: O
The O
pre- O
and O
intraoperative O
variables O
were O
comparable O
between O
the O
treatment O
groups. O
Postoperatively, O
a O
significantly O
higher O
incidence O
of O
seizures B
was O
found O
in O
Group O
T O
(4.6% O
vs O
1.2%, O
P O
< O
0.001). O
This O
difference O
was O
also O
significant O
in O
the O
primary O
valve O

and O
the O
high O

subgroups O
(7.9% O
vs O
1.2%, O
P O
= O
0.003; O
7.3% O

0.020) O
and O
renal B

(9.7% O
vs O
1.7%, O
P O

0.002) O
were O
also O
more O
common O
in O
Group O
T, O
in O
the O
primary O
valve O

subgroup. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
among O
primary O
coronary O

patients, O
there O
were O
more O
acute O
myocardial B
infarctions I
and O
renal B

in O
Group O
A O
(5.8% O
vs O
2.0%, O
P O
= O
0.027; O
22.5% O
vs O
15.2%, O
P O
= O
0.036, O
respectively). O
The O
1-yr O
mortality O
was O
significantly O
higher O
after O
aprotinin O
treatment O
in O
the O
high O
risk O
surgery O
group O
(17.7% O
vs O
9.8%, O
P O
= O
0.034). O
CONCLUSION: O
Both O
antifibrinolytic O
drugs O
bear O
the O
risk O
of O
adverse O
outcome O
depending O
on O
the O
type O
of O
cardiac O
surgery. O
Administration O
of O
aprotinin O
should O
be O
avoided O
in O
coronary O

patients, O
whereas O
administration O
of O
tranexamic O

The O
biological O
properties O
of O
the O
optical O
isomers O
of O
propranolol O
and O
their O
effects O
on O
cardiac B
arrhythmias. I

1. O
The O
optical O
isomers O
of O
propranolol O
have O
been O
compared O
for O
their O
beta-blocking O
and O
antiarrhythmic O
activities.2. O
In O
blocking O
the O
positive O
inotropic O
and O
chronotropic O
responses O
to O
isoprenaline, O
(+)-propranolol O
had O
less O
than O
one O
hundredth O
the O
potency O
of O
(-)-propranolol. O
At O
dose O
levels O
of O
(+)-propranolol O
which O
attenuated O
the O
responses O
to O
isoprenaline, O
there O
was O
a O
significant O
prolongation O
of O
the O
PR O
interval O
of O
the O
electrocardiogram.3. O
The O
metabolic O
responses O
to O
isoprenaline O
in O
dogs O
(an O
increase O
in O
circulating O
glucose, O
lactate O
and O
free O
fatty O
acids) O
were O
all O
blocked O
by O
(-)-propranolol. O
(+)-Propranolol O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
fatty O
acid O
mobilization O
but O
significantly O
reduced O
the O
increments O
in O
both O
lactate O
and O
glucose.4. O
Both O
isomers O
of O
propranolol O
possessed O
similar O
depressant O
potency O
on O
isolated O
atrial O
muscle O
taken O
from O
guinea-pigs.5. O
The O
isomers O
of O
propranolol O
exhibited O
similar O
local O
anaesthetic O
potencies O
on O
an O
isolated O
frog O
nerve O
preparation O
at O
a O
level O
approximately O
three O
times O
that O
of O
procaine. O
The O
racemic O
compound O
was O
significantly O
less O
potent O
than O
either O
isomer.6. O
Both O
isomers O
of O
propranolol O
were O
capable O
of O
preventing O
adrenaline-induced O
cardiac B
arrhythmias B
in O
cats O
anaesthetized O
with O
halothane, O
but O
the O
mean O
dose O
of O
(-)-propranolol O
was O
0.09+/-0.02 O
mg/kg O
whereas O
that O
of O
(+)-propranolol O
was O
4.2+/-1.2 O
mg/kg. O
At O
the O
effective O
dose O
level O
of O
(+)-propranolol O
there O
was O
a O
significant O
prolongation O
of O
the O
PR O
interval O
of O
the O
electrocardiogram. O
Blockade O
of O
arrhythmias O
with O
both O
isomers O
was O
surmountable O
by O
increasing O
the O
dose O
of O
adrenaline.7. O
Both O
isomers O
of O
propranolol O
were O
also O
capable O
of O
reversing O
ventricular B
tachycardia I
caused O
by O
ouabain O
in O
anaesthetized O
cats O
and O
dogs. O
The O
dose O
of O
(-)-propranolol O
was O
significantly O
smaller O
than O
that O
of O
(+)-propranolol O
in O
both O
species O
but O
much O
higher O
than O
that O
required O
to O
produce O
evidence O
of O
beta-blockade.8. O
The O
implications O
of O
these O
results O
are O

Improving O
glioblastoma B

(GBM) O
treatment B
with O
radio-chemotherapy O
remains O
a O
challenge. O
Topotecan O
is O
an O
attractive O
option O
as O
it O
exhibits O
growth O
inhibition O
of O
human O
glioma B
as O
well O
as O

The O
present O
study O
assessed O
the O
combination O
of O
radiotherapy O
(60 O
Gy/30 O

and O
topotecan O
(0.9 O
mg/m(2)/day O

1, O
3 O
and O
5) O
in O
50 O
adults O
with O
histologically O
proven O
and O
untreated O
GBM. O
The O
incidence O
of O
non-hematological O
toxicities B
was O
low O
and O
grade O
3-4 O
hematological O
toxicities O
were O
reported O
in O
20 O
patients O
(mainly O
lymphopenia B
and O
neutropenia). B
Partial O
response O
and O
stabilization O
rates O
were O
2% O
and O
32%, O
respectively, O
with O
an O
overall O
time O
to O
progression O
of O
12 O
weeks. O
One-year O
overall O
survival O
(OS) O
rate O
was O
42%, O
with O
a O
median O
OS O
of O
40 O
weeks. O
Topotecan O
in O
combination O
with O
radiotherapy O
was O
well O
tolerated. O
However, O
while O
response O
and O
stabilization O
concerned O
one-third O
of O
the O
patients, O
the O
study O
did O
not O
show O
increased O

report. O

PURPOSE: O
This O
paper O
reviews O
the O
effect O
of O
chronic O
lithium O
therapy O
on O
serum O
calcium O
level O
and O
parathyroid O
glands, O
its O
pathogenesis, O
and O
treatment O
options. O
We O
examined O
the O
case O
of O
a O
lithium-treated O
patient O
who O
had O
recurrent O
hypercalcemia B
to O
better O
understand O
the O
disease O
process. O
CONCLUSION: O
Primary B
hyperparathyroidism I
is O
a O
rare O
but O
potentially O
life-threatening O
side O
effect O
of O
long-term O
lithium O
therapy. O
Careful O
patient O
selection O
and O
long-term O
follow-up O
can O
reduce O
morbidity. O
PRACTICAL O
IMPLICATIONS: O
As O
much O
as O
15% O
of O
lithium-treated O
patients O
become O
hypercalcemic. B
By O
routinely O
monitoring O
serum O
calcium O
levels, O
healthcare O
providers O
can O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
of O
this O
patient O
group. O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
compare O
surgical O
conditions, O
including O
the O
amount O
of O
intraoperative O
bleeding B
as O
well O
as O
intraoperative O
blood O

(ETT) O
in O
maintaining O
controlled O
hypotension B

I-II O
adult O
patients O
undergoing O
FESS O
under O
controlled O
hypotension O

caused O
by O
propofol-remifentanil-TIVA O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
into O
two O
groups: O
group O
I, O
FRLMA; O
group O
II, O
ETT. O
Hemorrhage B
was O
measured O
and O
the O
visibility O
of O
the O
operative O
field O
was O
evaluated O
according O
to O
a O
six-point O
scale. O
RESULTS: O
Controlled O
hypotension O
was O
achieved O
within O
a O
shorter O
period O
using O
laryngeal O
mask O
using O
lower O
rates O
of O
remifentanil O
infusion O
and O
lower O
total O
dose O
of O
remifentanil. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
summary, O
our O
results O
indicate O
that O
airway O
management O
using O
FRLMA O
during O
controlled O
hypotension O
anesthesia O
provided O
better O
surgical O
conditions O
in O
terms O
of O

therapy. O

Valproic O
acid O
(VPA) O
is O
effective O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
many O
types O
of O
epilepsy, B
but O
its O
use O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
an O
increase O

We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
nonalcoholic B
fatty I
liver I
disease I
(NAFLD) O
arising B
in O
a O
child O
who O
developed O
obesity B
during O
VPA O
treatment. O
Laboratory O
data O
revealed O
hyperinsulinemia B
with O
insulin B
resistance. I
After O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
VPA O
therapy, O
our O
patient O
showed O
a O
significant O

a O
decrease O
of O

The O
present O
case O
suggests O
that O
obesity, O
hyperinsulinemia, O
insulin O
resistance, O
and O
long-term O
treatment O
with O
VPA O
may O
be O
all O
associated O

1 O
good-quality O
RCT, O
1 O
good-quality O
meta-analysis, O
and O
2 O
fair-quality O

the O
number O
of O
CVD O

CVD. O
Men O
in O
these O
studies O
experienced O
fewer O

Aspirin O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
affect O
CVD O
mortality O
or O
all-cause O
mortality O
in O
either O
men O
or O

The O
use O
of O
aspirin O
for O
primary O

increases O
the O
risk O
for O
major O
bleeding O
events, O
primarily O
gastrointestinal O

events, O
in O
both O
men O
and O
women. O
Men O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
hemorrhagic O
strokes O
with O
aspirin O
use. O
A O
new O
RCT O
and O

suggest O
that O
the O
risk O
for O
hemorrhagic O

is O
not O
statistically O
significantly O
increased. O
LIMITATIONS: O
New O
evidence O
on O
aspirin O
for O
the O
primary O
prevention O
of O
CVD O
is O
limited. O
The O
dose O
of O

in O
the O
RCTs O
varied, O
which O
prevented O
the O
estimation O
of O
the O
most O

Several O
of O
the O
RCTs O
were O
conducted O
within O
populations O

generalizability. O
CONCLUSION: O
Aspirin O
reduces O
the O
risk O
for O
myocardial O

in O
men O

in O
a O
heroin-dependent O
male O
under O
methadone O

therapy. O

OBJECTIVE: O
There O
are O
several O
complications O
associated O
with O
heroin B
abuse, I
some O
of O
which O
are O
life-threatening. O
Methadone O
may O
aggravate O
this O
problem. O
METHOD: O
A O
clinical O
case O
description. O
RESULTS: O
A O
33-year-old O
man O
presented O
with O
rhabdomyolysis B
and O
cerebral O
ischemic B
stroke B
after O
intravenous O
heroin. O
He O
had O
used O
heroin O
since O
age O
20, O
and O
had O
used O
150 O
mg O
methadone O
daily O
for O
6 O
months. O
He O
was O
found O
unconsciousness B
at O
home O
and O
was O
sent O
to O
our O
hospital. O
In O
the O
ER, O
his O
opiate O
level O
was O
4497 O
ng/ml. O
In O
the O
ICU, O
we O
found O
rhabdomyolysis, O
acute B
renal I
failure I
and O
acute O
respiratory B
failure. I
After O
transfer O
to O
an O
internal O
ward, O
we O
noted O
aphasia B
and O
weakness B
of O
his O
left O
limbs. O
After O
MRI, O
we O
found O
cerebral B
ischemic I
infarction. I
CONCLUSION: O
Those O
using O
methadone O
and O
heroin O
simultaneously O
may O
increase O
risk O
of O
rhabdomyolysis O
and O
ischemic O
stroke. O
Patients O
under O
methadone O
maintenance O
therapy O
should O
be O
warned O
regarding O
these O
serious O
adverse O
events. O
Hypotheses O
of O

in O
6-OHDA-lesioned O

A O

produced O
more O
severe O

in O
CB1 O

accompanied O
by O
more O
loss O
of O

and O
increased O
PENK O

in O
the O
CPu. O
Oxidative/nitrosative O
and O
neuroinflammatory O
parameters O
were O
estimated O
in O
the O
CPu O
and O

(Cg). O
CB1 O
KO O
mice O
exhibited O
higher O
MDA O
levels O
and O
iNOS O
protein O
expression O
in O
the O
CPu O
and O
Cg O
compared O
to O
WT O
mice. O
Treatment O
with O
L-DOPA+benserazide O
(12 O
weeks) O
resulted O
in O
less O
severe O
dyskinesias B
in O
CB1 O
KO O
than O
in O
WT O
mice. O
The O
results O
revealed O
that O
the O
lack O
of O
cannabinoid O
CB1 O
receptors O
increased O
the O
severity O
of O
motor O
impairment O
and O
DA O
lesion, O
and O
reduced O
L-DOPA-induced O
dyskinesias. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
activation O
of O
CB1 O
receptors O
offers O
neuroprotection O
against O
dopaminergic O
lesion O
and O
the O
development O
of O
L-DOPA-induced O

The O
intracerebroventricular O
(ICV) O
administration O
of O
ouabain O
(a O
Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase O
inhibitor) O
in O
rats O
has O
been O
suggested O
to O
mimic O
some O
symptoms O
of O
human O
bipolar B
mania. B
Clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
bipolar B

may O
be O
related O
to O
mitochondrial B

Herein, O
we O
investigated O
the O
behavioral O
and O
biochemical O
effects O
induced O
by O
the O
ICV O
administration O
of O
ouabain O
in O
rats. O
To O
achieve O
this O
aim, O
the O
effects O
of O
ouabain O
injection O
immediately O
after O
and O
7 O
days O
following O
a O
single O
ICV O
administration O
(at O
concentrations O
of O
10(-2) O
and O
10(-3)M) O
on O
locomotion O
was O
measured O
using O
the O
open-field O
test. O
Additionally, O
thiobarbituric O
acid O
reactive O

(TBARSs) O
and O
superoxide O
production O
were O
measured O
in O
submitochondrial O
particles O
of O
the O
prefrontal O
cortex, O
hippocampus, O
striatum O
and O
amygdala. O
Our O
findings O
demonstrated O
that O
ouabain O
at O
10(-2) O
and O
10(-3)M O
induced O
hyperlocomotion B
in O
rats, O
and O
this O
response O
remained O
up O
to O
7 O
days O
following O
a O
single O
ICV O
injection. O
In O
addition, O
we O
observed O
that O
the O
persistent O
increase O
in O
the O
rat O
spontaneous O
locomotion O
is O
associated O
with O
increased O
TBARS O
levels O
and O
superoxide O
generation O
in O
submitochondrial O
particles O
in O
the O
prefrontal O
cortex, O
striatum O
and O
amygdala. O
In O
conclusion, O
ouabain-induced O
mania-like O
behavior O
may O
provide O
a O
useful O
animal O
model O
to O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
the O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
describe O
a O
case O
of O
flecainide-induced O
delirium B
associated O
with O
a O
pharmacokinetic O
drug O
interaction O
with O
paroxetine. O
CASE O
SUMMARY: O
A O
69-year-old O
white O
female O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
with O
a O
history O
of O
confusion B
and O
paranoia B
over O
the O
past O
several O
days. O
On O
admission O
the O
patient O
was O
taking O
carvedilol O
12 O
mg O
twice O
daily, O
warfarin O
2 O
mg/day, O
folic O
acid O
1 O
mg/day, O
levothyroxine O
100 O
microg/day, O
pantoprazole O
40 O
mg/day, O
paroxetine O
40 O
mg/day, O
and O
flecainide O
100 O
mg O
twice O
daily. O
Flecainide O
had O
been O
started O
2 O
weeks O
prior O
for O
atrial B
fibrillation. I
Laboratory O
test O
findings O
on O
admission O
were O
notable O
only O
for O
a O
flecainide O
plasma O
concentration O
of O
1360 O
microg/L O
(reference O
range O
200-1000). O
A O
metabolic O
drug O
interaction O
between O
flecainide O
and O
paroxetine, O
which O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
taking O
for O
more O
than O
5 O
years, O
was O
considered. O
Paroxetine O
was O
discontinued O
and O
the O
dose O
of O
flecainide O
was O
reduced O
to O
50 O
mg O
twice O
daily. O
Her O
delirium O
resolved O
3 O
days O
later. O
DISCUSSION: O
Flecainide O
and O
pharmacologically O
similar O
agents O
that O
interact O
with O
sodium O
channels O
may O
cause O
delirium O
in O
susceptible O
patients. O
A O
MEDLINE O
search O
(1966-January O
2009) O
revealed O
one O
in O
vivo O
pharmacokinetic O
study O
on O
the O
interaction O
between O
flecainide, O
a O
CYP2D6 O
substrate, O
and O
paroxetine, O
a O
CYP2D6 O
inhibitor, O
as O
well O
as O
3 O
case O
reports O
of O
flecainide-induced O
delirium. O
According O
to O
the O
Naranjo O
probability O
scale, O
flecainide O
was O
the O
probable O
cause O
of O
the O
patient's O
delirium; O
the O
Horn O
Drug O
Interaction O
Probability O
Scale O
indicates O
a O
possible O
pharmacokinetic O
drug O
interaction O
between O
flecainide O
and O
paroxetine. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Supratherapeutic O
flecainide O
plasma O
concentrations O
may O
cause O
delirium. O
Because O
toxicity B
may O
occur O
when O
flecainide O
is O
prescribed O
with O
paroxetine O
and O
other O
potent O
CYP2D6 O
inhibitors, O
flecainide O
plasma O
concentrations O
should O
be O
monitored O
closely O
with O
commencement O
of O
CYP2D6 O
inhibitors. O

It O
occurs O
in O
12 O

BACKGROUND: O
Most O

In O
patients O
without O

coronary O
computerized O

(CTA) O
has O
been O

It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
a O
coronary O
CTA O
strategy O
would O
be O
efficacious O
in O
cocaine-associated O
chest O

as O
coronary B
vasospasm I
may O
account O
for O

We O
studied O
whether O
a O
negative O

transplant. O

OBJECTIVES: O
Posterior B
leukoencephalopathy I
due O
to O
calcineurin-inhibitor-related O
neurotoxicity B
is O
a O
rare O
but O
severe O
complication O
that O
results O
from O
treatment O
with O
immunosuppressive O
agents O
(primarily O
those O
administered O
after O
a O
liver O
or O
kidney O
transplant). O
The O
pathophysiologic O
mechanisms O
of O
that O
disorder O
remain O
unknown. O
CASE: O
We O
report O
the O
case O
of O
a O
46-year-old O
woman O
who O
received O
a O
liver O
transplant O
in O
our O
center O
as O
treatment O
for O
alcoholic B
cirrhosis I
and O
in O
whom O
either O
a O
fulminant O
course O
of O
posterior B
leukoencephalopathy I
or O
posterior B
reversible I
encephalopathy I
syndrome I
developed O
110 O
days O
after O
transplant. O
After O
an O
initially O
uneventful O
course O
after O
the O
transplant, O
the O
patient O
rapidly O
fell O
into O
deep O
coma. O
RESULTS: O
Cerebral O
MRI O
scan O
showed O
typical O
signs O
of O
enhancement O
in O
the O
pontine O
and O
posterior O
regions. O
Switching O
the O
immunosuppressive O
regimen O
from O
tacrolimus O
to O
cyclosporine O
did O
not O
improve O
the O
clinical O
situation. O
The O
termination O
of O
treatment O
with O
any O
calcineurin O
inhibitor O
resulted O
in O
a O
complete O
resolution O
of O
that O
complication. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Posterior B
reversible I
encephalopathy I
syndrome I
after O
liver O
transplant O
is O
rare. O
We O
recommend O
a O
complete O
cessation O
of O
any O
calcineurin O
inhibitor O
rather O
than O
a O
dose O
reduction. O

METHOD: O
Case-based O
observations O
from O
a O
medical O

unit O
(MICU) O
in O
a O

care O
facility O
in O
a O
27-year-old O
female O
with O
FHF O
from O
acetaminophen O
and O
resultant O
cerebral O
edema. O
RESULTS: O
Our O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
MICU O
after O
being O
found O
unresponsive O
with O
presumed O
toxicity B
from O
acetaminophen O
which O
was O
ingested O
over O
a O
2-day O
period. O
The O
patient O
had O
depressed O
of O
mental O
status O
lasting O
at O
least O
24 O
h O
prior O
to O
admission. O
Initial O
evaluation O
confirmed O
FHF O
from O
acetaminophen O
and O
cerebral O
edema. O
The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
hyperosmolar O
therapy, O
hyperventilation, B
sedation, O
and O
chemical O
paralysis. B
Her O
intracranial O
pressure O
remained O
elevated O
despite O
maximal O
medical O
therapy. O
We O
then O
initiated O
therapeutic O
hypothermia O
which O
was O
continued O
for O
5 O
days. O
At O
re-warming, O
patient O
had O
resolution O
of O
her O
cerebral O
edema O
and O
intracranial B
hypertension. I
At O
discharge, O
she O
had O
complete O
recovery O
of O
neurological O
and O
hepatic O
functions. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
patients O
with O
FHF O
and O
cerebral O
edema O
from O
acetaminophen O
overdose, B
prolonged O
therapeutic O
hypothermia O
could O
potentially O
be O
used O
as O
a O
life O
saving O
therapy O
and O
a O
bridge O
to O

BACKGROUND: O
Little O

known O
about O
the O
possible O
role O
that O
smoking O
crack O
cocaine O
has O
on O
the O
incidence O

Given O
the O

we O
sought O
to O
examine O
whether O
use O
of O
this O
illicit O

has O
become O
a O
risk O

METHODS: O
We O
included O

Drug O
Users O
Study O
who O
reported O

To O
determine O
whether O
the O
risk O

INTERPRETATION: O
Smoking O

to O
be O
an O

Cancer B
patients O
who O
have O
been O

have O
described O
experiencing O
deteriorations O
in O

A O
widely O
used O
chemotherapeutic O
agent, O
5-fluorouracil O
(5-FU), O
readily O
crosses O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
and O
so O
could O
have O
a O
direct O
effect O
on O
brain O
function. O
In O
particular O
this O
anti O
mitotic O
drug O
could O
reduce O
cell O
proliferation O
in O
the O
neurogenic O
regions O
of O
the O
adult O
brain. O
In O
contrast O
reports O
indicate O
that O
hippocampal O

neurogenesis O
and O

are O
enhanced O
by O
the O
SSRI O
antidepressant O
Fluoxetine. O
In O
this O
investigation O
the O
behavioural O
effects O
of O
chronic O
(two O
week) O
treatment O
with O
5-FU O
and O
(three O
weeks) O
with O
Fluoxetine O
either O
separately O
or O
in O
combination O
with O
5-FU O
were O
tested O
on O
adult O

rats. O
Behavioural O
effects O
were O
tested O
using O
a O
context O
dependent O
conditioned O
emotional O

test O
(CER) O
which O
showed O
that O
animals O
treated O
with O
5-FU O
had O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
freezing O
time O
compared O
to O
controls. O
A O

tested O
using O
a O
hippocampal O

(OLR). O
Animals O
treated O
only O
with O
5-FU O
showed O
significant O
deficits O
in O
their O
ability O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
OLR O
task O
but O
co O
administration O
of O
Fluoxetine O
improved O
their O
performance. O
5-FU O
chemotherapy O
caused O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
the O
number O
of O
proliferating O
cells O
in O
the O
sub O
granular O

This O
reduction O
was O
eliminated O
when O
Fluoxetine O
was O

administered O
with O
5-FU. O
Fluoxetine O
on O
its O
own O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
proliferating O
cell O
number O
or O
behaviour. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
5-FU O
can O
negatively O
affect O
both O
cell O
proliferation O
and O
hippocampal O

and O
that O
these O

The O
association O
between O

BACKGROUND: O
Neuroinflammation B
occurs O
after O
seizures B
and O
is O
implicated O
in O
epileptogenesis. O
CCR2 O
is O
a O

In O
this O

were O
examined O
following O
status B

(SE) O
induced B
by O
pilocarpine O

METHODS: O
SE O
was O
induced O
by O
pilocarpine O

Control O
rats O
were O
injected O
with O
saline O
instead O
of O
pilocarpine. O
Five O
days O
after O
SE, O
CCR2 O
staining O
in O
neurons O
and O
glial O
cells O
was O
examined O
using O
imunohistochemical O
analyses. O
The O
number O
of O
CCR2 O

was O
determined O
using O
stereology O
probes O
in O
the O
hippocampus. O
CCL2 O
expression O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
was O
examined O
by O
molecular O
assay. O
RESULTS: O
Increased O
CCR2 O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
after O
SE. O
Seizures B
also O
resulted O
in O
alterations O
to O
the O
cell O
types O
expressing O
CCR2. O
Increased O
numbers O
of O
neurons O
that O
expressed O
CCR2 O
was O
observed O
following O
SE. O
Microglial O
cells O
were O
more O
closely O
apposed O
to O
the O
CCR2-labeled O
cells O
in O
SE O
rats. O
In O
addition, O
rats O
that O
experienced O
SE O
exhibited O
CCR2-labeling O
in O
populations O
of O
hypertrophied B
astrocytes, O
especially O
in O
CA1 O
and O
dentate O

These O
CCR2+ O
astroctytes O
were O
not O
observed O
in O

rats. O
Examination O
of O
CCL2 O
expression O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
elevated O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
following O
SE. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
data O
show O
that O
CCR2 O
and O
CCL2 O
are O
up-regulated O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
after O
pilocarpine-induced O
SE. O
Seizures O
also O
result O
in O
changes O
to O
CCR2 O
receptor O
expression O
in O
neurons O
and O
astrocytes. O
These O
changes O
might O
be O
involved O
in O
detrimental O

Neuropsychiatric O
behaviors O
in O
the O
MPTP O
marmoset O
model O
of O
Parkinson's B
disease. I

OBJECTIVES: O
Neuropsychiatric O
symptoms O
are O
increasingly O
recognised O
as O
a O
significant O
problem O
in O
patients O
with O
Parkinson's B
disease I
(PD). O
These B
symptoms O
may O
be O
due O
to O
'sensitisation' O
following O
repeated O
levodopa O
treatment O
or O
a O
direct O
effect O
of O
dopamine O
on O
the O
disease O
state. O
The O
levodopa-treated O
MPTP-lesioned O
marmoset O
was O
used O
as O
a O
model O
of O
neuropsychiatric B
symptoms I
in O
PD O
patients. O
Here O
we O
compare O
the O
time O
course O
of O
levodopa-induced O
motor O
fluctuations O
and O
neuropsychiatric-like B
behaviors I
to O
determine O
the O
relationship O
between O
duration O
of O
treatment O
and O
onset O
of O
symptoms. O
METHODS: O
Marmosets O
were O
administered O
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine O
(2.0 O
mg/kg O
s.c.) O
for O
five O
days, O
resulting O
in O
stable O
parkinsonism. B
Levodopa O
(15 O
mg/kg O
and O
benserazide, O
3.75 O
mg/kg) O
p.o. O
b.i.d, O
was O
administered O
for O
30 O
days. O
Animals O
were O
evaluated O
for O
parkinsonian B
disability, I
dyskinesia B
and O
on-time O
(motor O
fluctuations) O
and O
neuropsychiatric-like O
behaviors O
on O
Day O
0 O
(prior O
to O
levodopa) O
and O
on O
Days O
1, O
7, O
13, O
27 O
and O
30 O
of O
treatment O
using O
post O
hoc O
DVD O
analysis O
by O
a O
trained O
rater, O
blind O
to O
the O
treatment O
day. O
RESULTS: O
The O
neuropsychiatric-like O
behavior O
rating O
scale O
demonstrated O
high O
interrater O
reliability O
between O
three O
trained O
raters O
of O
differing O
professional O
backgrounds. O
As O
anticipated, O
animals O
exhibited O
a O
progressive O
increase O
in O
levodopa-induced O
motor O
fluctuations, O
dyskinesia O
and O
wearing-off, O
that O
correlated O
with O
the O
duration O
of O
levodopa O
therapy. O
In O
contrast, O
levodopa-induced O
neuropsychiatric-like O
behaviors O
were O
present O
on O
Day O
1 O
of O
levodopa O
treatment O
and O
their O
severity O
did O
not O
correlate O
with O
duration O
of O
treatment. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
data O
suggest O
that O
neuropsychiatric B
disorders I
in O
PD O
are O
more O
likely O
an O
interaction O
between O
levodopa O
and O
the O
disease O
state O
than O
a O
consequence O
of O
sensitisation O
to O
repeated O
dopaminergic O
therapy. O

BACKGROUND: O
Renal B
dysfunction I
induced O
by O
iodinated O
contrast O
medium O
(CM) O
administration O
can O
minimize O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O

was O
measured. O
RESULTS: O
Postprocedural O
creatinine O

decreased O
nonsignificantly O
in O
the O
PTRA O
group O
(1.46+/-0.8 O

increased O
significantly O
in O
the O
PCI O
group O
(1.44+/-0.6 O
vs. O
1.57+/-0.7 O
mg/dl, O
P<0.02). O
Changes O
in O
serum O
creatinine O
after O

(after-before) O
were O
significantly O
different O
between O
the O
PTRA O
and O
PCI O
groups O
(-0.12+/-0.5 O
vs. O
0.13+/-0.3, O
P=0.014). O
This O
difference O
was O
not O
related O
to O
either O
a O
different O
clinical O
risk O
profile O
or O
to O
the O
volume O
of O
CM O
administered. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
this O
preliminary O
study O
patients O
submitted O
to O
PTRA O
showed O
a O
lower O
susceptibility O
to O
renal B
damage I
induced O
by O
CM O
administration O
than O
PCI O
patients. O
The O
effectiveness O
of O
PTRA O
on O
renal O

seems O
to O
be O
barely O
influenced O
by O

Heparin-induced O
thrombocytopenia: B
a O
practical O
review. O

Heparin-induced O
thrombocytopenia B
(HIT) O
remains B
under-recognized O
despite O
its O
potentially O
devastating O
outcomes. O
It O
begins O
when O
heparin O
exposure O
stimulates O
the O
formation O
of O
heparin-platelet O
factor O
4 O
antibodies, O
which O
in O
turn O
triggers O
the O
release O
of O
procoagulant O
platelet O
particles. O
Thrombosis B
and O
thrombocytopenia O
that O
follow O
comprise O
the O
2 O
hallmark O
traits O
of O
HIT, O
with O
the O
former O
largely O
responsible O
for O
significant O
vascular O
complications. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HIT O
varies O
among O
several O
subgroups, O
with O
greater O
incidence O
in O
surgical O
as O
compared O
with O
medical O
populations. O
HIT O
must O
be O
acknowledged O
for O
its O
intense O
predilection O
for O
thrombosis B
and O
suspected O
whenever O
thrombosis O
occurs O
after O
heparin O
exposure. O
Early O
recognition O
that O
incorporates O
the O
clinical O
and O
serologic O
clues O
is O
paramount O
to O
timely O
institution O
of O
treatment, O
as O
its O
delay O
may O
result O
in O
catastrophic O
outcomes. O
The O
treatment O
of O
HIT O
mandates O
an O
immediate O
cessation O
of O
all O
heparin O
exposure O
and O
the O
institution O
of O
an O
antithrombotic O
therapy, O
most O
commonly O
using O
a O
direct O
thrombin O
inhibitor. O
Current O
"diagnostic" O
tests, O
which O
primarily O
include O
functional O
and O
antigenic O
assays, O
have O
more O
of O
a O
confirmatory O
than O
diagnostic O
role O
in O
the O
management O
of O
HIT. O
Special O
attention O
must O
be O
paid O
to O
cardiac O
patients O
who O
are O
often O
exposed O
to O
heparin O
multiple O
times O
during O
their O
course O
of O
treatment. O
Direct O
thrombin O
inhibitors O
are O
appropriate, O
evidence-based O
alternatives O
to O
heparin O
in O
patients O
with O
a O
history O
of O
HIT, O
who O
need O
to O
undergo O
percutaneous O
coronary O
intervention. O
As O
heparin O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
frequently O
used O
medications O
today O
with O
potential O
for O
HIT O
with O
every O
heparin O
exposure, O
a O
close O
vigilance O
of O
platelet O
counts O
must O
be O
practiced O
whenever O
heparin O
is O
initiated. O

patients, O
eight O
patients O
suffered O
bilateral O
abductor O
paralysis, O
and O
two O
suffered O
this O
complication O
twice. O
All O
affected O
patients O
were O
females O
over O
the O
age O
of O
50 O
years. O
Most O
patients O
had O
received O
treatments O
prior O
to O
abductor O
paralysis O
and O
continued O
receiving O
after O
paralysis. O
Seven O
patients O
recovered O
after O
a O
brief O
period O
of O
activity O
restrictions, O
and O
one O
underwent O
a O
tracheotomy. O
The O
incidence O
of O
abductor O
paralysis O
after O
Botox O
injection O
for O
ADSD O
was O
0.34%. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Bilateral O
abductor O
paralysis O
is O
a O
rare O
complication O
of O
Botox O
injections O
for O
ADSD, O
causing O
difficulty O
with O
breathing O
upon O
exertion. O
The O
likely O
mechanism O
of O
paralysis O
is O
diffusion O
of O
Botox O
around O
the O
muscular O
process O
of O
the O
arytenoid O
to O
the O
posterior O
cricoarytenoid O
muscles. O
The O
paralysis O
is O
temporary, O
and O
watchful O
waiting O
with O
restriction O
of O
activity O
is O
the O
recommended O
management. O

Mitochondrial B

Prevention O
by O
the O
targeted O
antioxidant O
MitoQ. O

The O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
assess O
mitochondrial O
function O
and O
ROS O
production O
in O
an O
experimental O
model O
of O
cocaine-induced O
cardiac B
dysfunction. I
We O
hypothesized O
that O
cocaine B
abuse I
may O
lead O
to O
altered O
mitochondrial O
function O
that O
in O
turn O
may O
cause O
left B
ventricular I
dysfunction. I
Seven O
days O
of O
cocaine O
administration O
to O
rats O
led O
to O
an O
increased O
oxygen O
consumption O
detected O
in O
cardiac O
fibers, O
specifically O
through O
complex O
I O
and O
complex O
III. O
ROS O
levels O
were O
increased, O
specifically O
in O
interfibrillar O
mitochondria. O
In O
parallel O
there O
was O
a O
decrease O
in O
ATP O
synthesis, O
whereas O
no O
difference O
was O
observed O
in O
subsarcolemmal O
mitochondria. O
This O
uncoupling O
effect O
on O
oxidative O
phosphorylation O
was O
not O
detectable O
after O
short-term O
exposure O
to O
cocaine, O
suggesting O
that O
these O
mitochondrial B
abnormalities I
were O
a O
late O
rather O
than O
a O
primary O
event O
in O
the O
pathological O
response O
to O
cocaine. O
MitoQ, O
a O
mitochondrial-targeted O
antioxidant, O
was O
shown O
to O
completely O
prevent O
these O
mitochondrial O
abnormalities O
as O
well O
as O
cardiac O
dysfunction O
characterized O
here O
by O
a O
diastolic B
dysfunction I
studied O
with O
a O
conductance O
catheter O
to O
obtain O
pressure-volume O
data. O
Taken O
together, O
these O
results O
extend O
previous O
studies O
and O
demonstrate O
that O
cocaine-induced O
cardiac O
dysfunction O
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
mitochondrial B
defect. I

A O
10-year-old O

presented O
with O
post-chemotherapy O
anemia. B
During O
red O

transfusion, O
he O
developed O
hemoglobinuria. B
Transfusion O

was O
negative. O
Drug-induced O
immune O

using O
the O

were O
strongly O
positive O
with O
trimethoprim O
and O
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole O
but O
negative O
with O
sulfamethoxazole. O
The O
patient O
recovered O
after O
discontinuing O
the O
drug, O
with O
no O
recurrence O
in O
2 O
years. O
Other O
causes O
of O

should O
be O
considered O
in O
patients O
with O
worse-than-expected O
anemia O
after O
chemotherapy. O
Furthermore, O
hemolysis B
during O

OBJECTIVE: O
A O
multicenter, O

showed O
that O

blockade O
of O
the O
renin-angiotensin O
system O
in O
patients O
with O
type B

suggesting O
that O
other O
mechanism(s) O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
early O
diabetic B
nephropathy I
(diabetic O
nephropathy). O
We O
have O
previously O
demonstrated O
that O
endothelial-mesenchymal-transition O
(EndoMT) O
contributes O
to O
the O
early O
development O
of O
renal O

independently O
of O
microalbuminuria O
in O
mice O
with O
streptozotocin O
(STZ)-induced O
diabetes. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
hypothesized O
that O
blocking O
EndoMT O
reduces O
the O
early O

METHODS: O
EndoMT O

(MMEC) O
in O
the O

RESULTS: O
Confocal O

real-time O
PCR O
demonstrated O
that O
AGEs O
induced O
EndoMT O
in O
MMECs O
and O
in O
Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP O
mice. O
Immunoprecipitation/Western O

showed O
that O
Smad3 O

but O
was O
inhibited O
by O
SIS3 O
in O
MMECs O
and O
in O
STZ-induced O

further O
demonstrated O
that O
SIS3 O
abrogated O
EndoMT, O
reduced O
renal O

CONCLUSIONS: O
EndoMT O
is O
a O
novel O
pathway O
leading O
to O
early O
development O
of O
diabetic O

Cytostatic O
and O
anti-angiogenic O
effects O
of O
temsirolimus O
in O
refractory O
mantle B

lymphoma. I

Mantle B
cell I
lymphoma I
(MCL) O
is B
a O
rare O
and O
aggressive O
type O
of O
B-cell B
non-Hodgkin's I
lymphoma. I
Patients O
become O
progressively O
refractory O
to O
conventional O
chemotherapy, O
and O
their O
prognosis O
is O
poor. O
However, O
a O
38% O
remission O
rate O
has O
been O
recently O
reported O
in O
refractory O
MCL O
treated O
with O
temsirolimus, O
a O
mTOR O
inhibitor.Here O
we O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
study O
a O
case O
of O
refractory O
MCL O
who O
had O
tumor B
regression O
two O
months O
after O
temsirolimus O
treatment, O
and O
a O
progression-free O
survival O
of O
10 O
months. O
In O
this O
case, O
lymph O
node O
biopsies O
were O
performed O
before O
and O
six O
months O
after O
temsirolimus O
therapy. O
Comparison O
of O
the O
two O
biopsies O
showed O
that O
temsirolimus O
inhibited O
tumor O
cell O
proliferation O
through O
cell O
cycle O
arrest, O
but O
did O
not O
induce O
any O
change O
in O
the O
number O
of O
apoptotic O
tumor O
cells. O
Apart O
from O
this O
cytostatic O
effect, O
temsirolimus O
had O
an O
antiangiogenic O
effect O
with O
decrease O
of O
tumor O
microvessel O
density O
and O
of O
VEGF O
expression. O
Moreover, O
numerous O
patchy, O
well-limited O
fibrotic O
areas, O
compatible O
with O
post-necrotic O
tissue B
repair, O
were O
found O
after O
6-month O
temsirolimus O
therapy. O
Thus, O
temsirolimus O
reduced O
tumor O
burden O
through O
associated O
cytostatic O
and O
anti-angiogenic O
effects.This O
dual O
effect O
of O
temsirolimus O
on O
tumor O
tissue O
could O
contribute O
to O
its O
recently O
reported O
efficiency O
in O
refractory O
MCL O
resistant O
to O
conventional O
chemotherapy. O

year-old O
woman O
with O
a O
history O

prior O
myocardial B
infarction I
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
emergency O

due O
to O
marked O
bradycardia B
caused O
by O
hyperkalemia. B
The O
concentration O
of O

potassium O
was O
high, O
and O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
was O
restored O
after O
correction O
of O
the O
serum O
potassium O
level. O
The O
cause O
of O
hyperkalemia O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
several O
doses O
of O
spiranolactone, O
an O
aldosterone O
antagonist, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
long-term O
intake O
of O

an O
ACE O
inhibitor. O
This O
case O
is O
a O
good O
example O
of O
electrolyte O
imbalance O
causing O
acute O
life-threatening O
cardiac O
events. O
Clinicians O
should O
be O
alert O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
hyperkalemia, O
especially O
in O
elderly O
patients O
using O
ACE/ARB O
in O

Diffuse O
skeletal O
pain B
after O
administration O
of O
alendronate. O

BACKGROUND: O
Osteoporosis B
is O
caused O
by O
bone O
resorption O
in O
excess O
of O
bone O
formation, O
and O
bisphosphonates, O
are O
used O
to O
inhibit O
bone O
resorption. O
Alendronate, O
a O
biphosphonate, O
is O
effective O
for O
both O
the O
treatment O
and O
prevention O
of O
osteoporosis B
in O
postmenopausal O
women. O
Side O
effects O
are O
relatively O
few O
and O
prominently O
gastrointestinal. O
Musculoskeletal B
pain B
may O
be O
an O
important O
side O
effect O
in O
these O
patients. O
We O
presented O
a O
patient O
admitted O
to O
our O
out-patient O
clinic O
with O
diffuse O
skeletal O
pain O
after O
three O
consecutive O
administration O
of O
alendronate. O
CONCLUSION: O
We O
conclude O
that O
patients O
with O
osteoporosis O
can O
report O
pain, O
and O
bisphosphonate-related O
pain O
should O
also O
be O
considered O
before O
ascribing O
this O
complaint O
to O
osteoporosis. O

CASE O
SUMMARY: O
A O
54-year-old O
male O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
with O
generalized O
weakness B
and O
presumed O
health-care-associated O
pneumonia B
shown O
on O
chest O
radiograph. O
Treatment O
was O
empirically O
initiated O
with O
vancomycin, O
levofloxacin, O
and O
piperacillin/tazobactam. O
Blood O
cultures O
revealed O
S. O
aureus O
susceptible O
to O
oxacillin. O
Empiric O
antibiotic O
treatment O
was O
narrowed O
to O
nafcillin O
on O
day O
4. O
On O
day O
8, O
the O
patient O
developed O
acute B
renal I
failure I
(serum O
creatinine O
1.9 O
mg/dL, O
increased O
from O
1.2 O
mg/dL O
the O
previous O
day O
and O
0.8 O
mg/dL O
on O
admission). O
The O
patient's O
Glasgow O

of O
the O
head O
72 O
hours O
following O
an O
episode O
of O
cardiac B
arrest I
on O
day O
10. O
The O
patient O
experienced O
relapsing O
MSSA O
bacteremia O
on O
day O
9, O
increasing O
the O
suspicion O
for O
a O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS) O
infection. B
Nafcillin O
was O
discontinued O
and O
daptomycin O
9 O
mg/kg O
daily O
was O
initiated O
for O
suspected O
meningitis O
and O
was O
continued O
until O
the O
patient's O
death O
on O
day O
16. O
Daptomycin O
serum O
and O
CSF O
trough O
concentrations O
were O
11.21 O
ug/mL O
and O
0.52 O
ug/mL, O
respectively, O
prior O
to O
the O
third O
dose. O
Lumbar O
puncture O
results O
were O
inconclusive O
and O
no O
further O
blood O
cultures O
were O
positive O
for O
MSSA. O
Creatine O
kinase O
levels O
were O
normal O
prior O
to O
daptomycin O
therapy O
and O
were O
not O
reassessed. O
DISCUSSION: O
Daptomycin O
was O
initiated O
in O
our O
patient O
secondary O
to O
possible O
nafcillin-induced O
acute O
interstitial B
nephritis I
and O
relapsing O
bacteremia. O
At O
a O
dose O
of O
9 O
mg/kg, O
resultant O
penetration O
of O
5% O
was O
higher O
than O
in O
previous O
reports, O
more O
consistent O
with O
inflamed O
meninges. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
High-dose O
daptomycin O
may O
be O
an O
alternative O
option O
for O
MSSA O
bacteremia O
with O
or O
without O
a O
CNS O
source O
in O
patients O
who O
have O
failed O
or O
cannot O
tolerate O
standard O
therapy. O
Further O
clinical O
evaluation O
in O
patients O
with O
confirmed O
meningitis O
is O
warranted. O

The O
role O
of O
nitric O
oxide O
in O
convulsions B
induced O
by O
lindane O
in O
rats. O

Lindane O
is O
an O
organochloride O
pesticide O
and O
scabicide. O
It O
evokes O
convulsions B
mainly O
trough O
the O
blockage O
of O
GABA(A) O
receptors. O
Nitric O
oxide O
(NO), O
gaseous O
neurotransmitter, O
has O
contradictor O
role O
in O
epileptogenesis O
due O
to O
opposite O
effects O
of O
L-arginine, O
precursor O
of O
NO O
syntheses O
(NOS), O
and O
L-NAME O
(NOS O
inhibitor) O
observed O
in O
different O
epilepsy B
models. O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
effects O
of O
NO O
on O
the O
behavioral O
and O
EEG O
characteristics O
of O
lindane-induced O
epilepsy O
in O
male O
Wistar O
albino O
rats. O
The O
administration O
of O
L-arginine O
(600, O
800 O
and O
1000 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.) O
in O
dose-dependent O
manner O
significantly O
increased O
convulsion O
incidence O
and O
severity O
and O
shortened O
latency O
time O
to O
first O
convulsion O
elicited O
by O
lower O
lindane O
dose O
(4 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.). O
On O
the O
contrary, O
pretreatment O
with O
L-NAME O
(500, O
700 O
and O
900 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.) O
decreased O
convulsion O
incidence O
and O
severity O
and O
prolonged O
latency O
time O
to O
convulsion O
following O
injection O
with O
a O
convulsive B
dose O
of O
lindane O
(8 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.). O
EEG O
analyses O
showed O
increase O
of O
number O
and O
duration O
of O
ictal O
periods O
in O
EEG O
of O
rats O
receiving O
l-arginine O
prior O
to O
lindane O
and O
decrease O
of O
this O
number O
in O
rats O
pretreated O
with O
L-NAME. O
These O
results O
support O
the O
conclusion O
that O
NO O
plays O
a O
role O
of O
endogenous O
convulsant O
in O
rat O
model O
of O
lindane O
seizures. B
