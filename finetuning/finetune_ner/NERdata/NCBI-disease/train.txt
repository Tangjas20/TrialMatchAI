RESULTS O
Before O

After O

, O
the O
three O

CONCLUSIONS O
Lorenzos O
oil O

had O
no O

Moreover O
, O
in O

this O

modify O
significantly O
the O

However O
, O
because O

we O

whether O

we O
explore O

At O

We O

The O
PAX6 O

The O

In O
this O

disorders O
, O
a O

adopts O
a O

The O

we O

it O
also O

In O
addition O
, O
expression O

allowing O

Fractionation O

immunochemical O
experiments O
indicate O
that O
this O
novel O
conformation O
of O
intranuclear O
ataxin O

is O
not O
due O
to O
proteolysis O
, O
suggesting O
instead O
that O
association O

alters O
the O

ataxin O

which O
exposes O

This O
conformationally O
altered O
ataxin O

The O
pathological O
form O

with O
an O

also O
associates O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
an O
early O
event O

be O

To O

we O

the O

The O
gene O

encodes O
a O

emerin O
that O

To O

a O

we O
examined O
the O

using O

We O
found O
that O

were O
localized O

the O
nucleoplasmic O
surface O
of O
the O

not O
on O

Emerin O
stayed O

even O
after O

treatment O
that O
solubilizes O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
emerin O
anchors O

We O

we O
have O

Our O

demonstrate O
that O
the O

As O

these O

that O

A O

were O
found O
to O

These O

CONCLUSIONS O

The O
results O
that O

observed O

that O

the O

the O

that O

We O
engineered O

The O

We O

These O

that O
aniridia B

is O
caused O
by O

We O
present O
the O

the O

We O
have O
isolated O
three O

we O
have O
used O

85 O

the O

in O

CONCLUSIONS O

The O

believe O
the O
unique O

is O
a O

The O

Second O
, O
the O
expanded O

MJD B
displays O
inter O

generational O

, O
particularly O
in O
male O

, O
and O
this O
instability O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
clinical O
phenomenon O

Third O
, O
the O
size O
of O
the O
expanded O
allele O
is O
not O
only O
inversely O

in O
a O
subject O
homozygous O
for O
the O
expanded O
allele O
, O
which O
contrasts O
with O
Huntington B
disease I
and O
suggests O
that O
the O
expanded O
allele O
in O
the O
MJD1 O
gene O
could O
exert O
its O
effect O
either O
by O
a O

Finally O
, O
Japanese O

( O

, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
our O
patient O

was O
related O

the O
recent O

 O
Our O

later O
in O
a O

 O
At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
cardiology O
department O
recommended O
stopping O
further O
chemotherapy O
with O
gemcitabine O
. O

 O
The O
oncology O
department O
advised O
further O
testing O
to O
rule O
out O
ischemia O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
CMP O
as O
, O
in O
their O
opinion O
, O
chemotherapy O
with O
gemcitabine O
was O
the O
only O
option O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
recurrence O
in O
this O
patient O
. O

 O
Two O
weeks O
later O
, O
our O
patient O

any O
evidence O
of O
active O

 O
The O
ejection O

( O

on O
MPI O
was O
calculated O
to O
be O
around O
17 O
to O
20 O
percent O
with O
severe O
global O
hypokinesia O
. O

 O
Our O
patient O
was O

 O
He O
responded O
well O
to O

. O

 O
A O
2D O

was O
repeated O
a O
few O
months O
later O
and O
it O
showed O
improvement O
in O
systolic O
function O
with O
an O
LVEF O
of O
40 O
percent O
. O

 O
Due O
to O
his O
poor O
functional O
status O
and O
underlying O
CMP O
, O
further O
gemcitabine O
chemotherapy O
was O
stopped O
. O

 O
Later O
, O
our O
patient O
developed O
a O
recurrence O
of O
his O
pancreatic O

; O
he O
refused O

 O
The O

a O

the O

 O
A O
paraneoplastic O
panel O
could O
be O
considered O

but O
it O
would O
delay O
diagnosis O
, O
and O
the O
presentation O
is O
most O
consistent O
with O
nutritional O
deficiency O
. O

 O
It O
is O
not O
appropriate O
to O
start O
a O
topical O
steroid O
cream O
until O

 O
Because O

we O

 O
An O

 O
Because O
the O

in O
this O

we O
performed O
a O

 O
Therefore O

we O

 O
Increasing O

been O
an O

 O
An O

increase O

the O

induces O

 O
However O
, O
weekly O

( O

, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
our O
patient O

CMP O
was O
related O
to O
the O
recent O
use O
of O
gemcitabine O
. O

 O
Our O

 O
At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
cardiology O
department O
recommended O
stopping O
further O
chemotherapy O
with O
gemcitabine O
. O

 O
The O
oncology O
department O
advised O
further O
testing O
to O
rule O
out O
ischemia O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
CMP O
as O
, O
in O
their O
opinion O
, O
chemotherapy O
with O
gemcitabine O
was O
the O
only O
option O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
recurrence O
in O
this O
patient O

 O
Two O

any O
evidence O

 O
The O

was O
calculated O
to O
be O
around O
17 O

20 O
percent O
with O
severe O

 O
Our O

 O
A O
2D O

later O
and O
it O
showed O
improvement O
in O
systolic O
function O
with O
an O
LVEF O
of O
40 O
percent O
. O

 O
Due O
to O
his O
poor O
functional O
status O
and O
underlying O
CMP O
, O
further O
gemcitabine O
chemotherapy O
was O
stopped O
. O

 O
Later O
, O
our O
patient O
developed O
a O
recurrence O
of O
his O
pancreatic O
cancer O
; O
he O
refused O
further O
chemotherapy O
and O
decided O
to O
proceed O
with O

 O
Although O
the O
exact O
etiology O
of O
our O
patient O

dilated O
cardiomyopathy B
remains O
unclear O

remains O
the O
most O
likely O
culprit O

 O
The O
temporal O
relationship O

 O
Elevated O

an O

primary O
hyperparathyroidism O

 O
Historically O
, O
hyperparathyroidism O
is O
associated O
with O
bone O
disease O
, O
renal O
stones O
and O
neuromuscular O
dysfunction O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
current O
screening O
modalities O
, O
most O
patients O
are O
caught O
early O
and O
often O
asymptomatic.3 O
Primary O
hyperparathyroidism O
is O
most O
commonly O
caused O
by O
a O
parathyroid O
adenoma O
. O

 O
Infrequent O
causes O
include O
parathyroid O
hyperplasia O
, O
which O
would O
affect O
all O
four O
glands O
and O
rarely O
caused O
by O
parathyroid O
carcinoma O

 O
Markedly O
elevated O
serum O
PTH O
and O
calcium O
levels O
leading O
to O
severe O
renal O
and O
bone O
manifestations O
are O
helpful O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
cancer O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
usually O
discovered O
operatively O
based O
on O
local O

 O
The O
primary O
indication O
for O
parathyroidectomy O
, O
historically O

is O
for O
symptomatic O
patients O

 O
Currently O
, O
since O
most O
patients O
are O
caught O
earlier O
, O
there O
are O
newer O
indications O
for O
surgery O
. O

 O
These O
include O
an O

with O
any O

This O
patient O
presented O
with O
pain O
, O
markedly O
elevated O
PTH O
, O
and O
was O
younger O
than O
50 O
  O
years O
old O
, O
so O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
surgery O
was O
the O
best O
choice O
in O
management O
. O

 O
The O
patient O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
and O
underwent O
a O
parathyroidectomy O
. O

 O
The O
surgeon O
found O
the O
parathyroid O
gland O
to O
be O
firm O
and O
densely O
adherent O
to O
the O
thyroid O
capsule O
and O
overlying O
strap O
muscle O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
dissect O
. O

 O
There O
was O
no O
visible O
invasion O
into O
the O
capsule O
, O
surrounding O
muscle O
or O
regional O
lymph O
nodes O
. O

 O
The O
resected O
specimen O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
brownish O
grey O
in O
colour O
with O
scattered O
necrotic O
foci O
, O
and O
irregular O
texture O
. O

 O
On O
postoperative O
pathology O
, O
the O
specimen O
was O
confirmed O
positive O
for O
parathyroid O
carcinoma O
with O
capsular O
invasion O
, O
focal O
tumour O
necrosis O
, O
reactive O
fibrosis O
and O
local O
skeletal O
muscle O
invasion O
( O

. O

 O
Margins O
were O
resected O
. O

 O
Immunohistochemical O

showed O
increased O
Ki-67 O

as O
well O
as O
strong O

, O
which O

the O

of O
parathyroid O

( O

) O
. O

 O
Additionally O
, O
P57 O
staining O
was O
negative O
. O

 O
Although O
most O
reports O
of O
parathyroid O
carcinomas O
are O
associated O
with O
marked O
hypercalcaemia O
, O
non O
- O
functioning O
cancers O
in O
patients O
tend O
to O
behave O
more O
aggressively.1 O
Owing O
to O
the O
severity O
and O
uncertainty O
of O
the O
lesion O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
followed O
up O
postoperatively O
for O
repeat O
imaging O
to O
determine O
if O
residual O
tumour O
remained O
. O

 O
Repeat O
sestamibi O
and O
positron O
emission O
tomography O
( O
PET O
) O
scan O
revealed O
residual O
activity O
along O
the O
surgical O
area O
so O
the O
patient O
subsequently O
underwent O
a O
second O
operation O
for O
a O
radical O
left O
neck O
dissection O
and O
left O
hemithyroidectomy O
. O

 O
The O
patient O
recovered O
very O
well O
postoperatively O
and O
it O
has O
now O
been O
3 O
  O
years O
since O
the O
second O
surgery O
. O

 O
The O
patient O
continues O
to O
do O
very O
well O
and O
is O
followed O
up O
every O
3 O
  O
months O
to O
monitor O
serum O
PTH O
and O
calcium O
levels O
. O

 O
She O
no O
longer O
reports O
of O

 O
Sometimes O
the O
patient O

show O
marginally O
elevated O

, O
however O
, O
she O
remains O
and O
follow O

up O
and O

continue O
to O

 O
The O
patient O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
monitored O
indefinitely O

 O
Our O
attention O

the O
fact O
that O
the O

 O
The O

 O
A O

 O
This O

 O
The O

 O
After O

 O
The O
abdominal O

 O
During O

have O
an O

overcome O
his O

over O
the O

 O
The O
synchrony O
achieved O
with O

allowed O
a O

decrease O

he O
received O
until O

 O
Concurrently O

his O

 O
Following O
discussion O
at O
a O

it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O

 O
Histological O
examination O

 O
These O

. O

 O
Our O
attention O
was O
piqued O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
patient O

described O
the O
patient O

 O
An O

 O
Morphological O
examination O
indicated O
that O

consisted O
of O
small O

 O
The O
abdominal O

 O
Bowel O

 O
Escherichia O

 O
A O
presumptive O
diagnosis O
of O
ECF B

reached O
; O
this O
diagnosis O
was O
mainly O
based O
on O
digital O
radiography O
of O
the O
fistulous O
tract O
conducted O
using O
iopamidol-370 O
as O
a O
contrast O
agent O
. O

 O
This O
procedure O
was O
performed O
under O

revealed O
that O
the O
distal O
ileum O
approximately O
40 O
cm O
from O
the O

was O
entrapped O
( O

 O
The O

 O
After O

 O
The O
abdominal O

of O
the O
terminal O
ileum O
( O
approximately O
40 O

proximal O
to O
the O
ileocaecal O
junction O
) O
was O
found O
entrapped O
in O
the O
internal O
hernia O

this O
finding O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
preoperative O

 O
The O
defect O
in O
the O

Historically O

Primary O
hyperparathyroidism O
is O
most O
commonly O
caused O
by O
a O
parathyroid O

 O
Infrequent O
causes O
include O

 O
The O

 O
Currently O
, O
since O

there O
are O

 O
These O

This O

presented O
with O

, O
markedly O
elevated O
PTH O
, O
and O
was O
younger O
than O
50 O
  O
years O
old O
, O
so O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
surgery O
was O
the O
best O
choice O
in O
management O
. O

 O
The O
patient O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
and O
underwent O
a O
parathyroidectomy O
. O

 O
The O
surgeon O
found O
the O
parathyroid O
gland O
to O
be O
firm O
and O
densely O
adherent O
to O
the O
thyroid O
capsule O
and O
overlying O
strap O
muscle O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
dissect O

 O
There O
was O
no O
visible O
invasion O
into O
the O
capsule O
, O
surrounding O
muscle O
or O
regional O

 O
The O
resected O

noted O
to O
be O
brownish O
grey O
in O
colour O
with O
scattered O
necrotic O
foci O
, O
and O
irregular O
texture O
. O

 O
On O
postoperative O
pathology O
, O
the O
specimen O
was O
confirmed O
positive O
for O
parathyroid O
carcinoma O
with O
capsular O
invasion O
, O
focal O
tumour O
necrosis O
, O
reactive O

and O

( O

 O
Margins O

 O
Additionally O
, O
P57 O

 O
Although O
most O

of O
parathyroid O
carcinomas O
are O
associated O
with O
marked O
hypercalcaemia O
, O
non O

functioning O
cancers O
in O
patients O
tend O
to O
behave O
more O
aggressively.1 O
Owing O
to O
the O
severity O
and O
uncertainty O
of O
the O
lesion O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
followed O
up O
postoperatively O
for O
repeat O

determine O
if O

 O
Repeat O
sestamibi O
and O
positron O

( O
PET O
) O
scan O
revealed O
residual O
activity O
along O
the O
surgical O
area O
so O
the O
patient O
subsequently O
underwent O
a O
second O
operation O
for O
a O
radical O
left O
neck O
dissection O
and O
left O
hemithyroidectomy O

 O
The O

recovered O
very O
well O
postoperatively O

it O
has O
now O
been O
3 O

The O

Hyperprolactinemia B
can O
reduce O
fertility O
and O
libido. O
Although O
central O
prolactin O
actions O
are O
thought O
to O
contribute O
to O
this, O
the O
mechanisms O
are O
poorly O
understood. O
We O
first O
tested O
whether O
chronic O
hyperprolactinemia B
inhibited O
two O
neuroendocrine O
parameters O
necessary O
for O
female O
fertility: O
pulsatile O
LH O
secretion O
and O
the O
estrogen-induced O
LH O
surge. O
Chronic O
hyperprolactinemia O
induced O
by O
the O
dopamine O
antagonist O
sulpiride O
caused O
a O
40% O
reduction O
LH O
pulse O
frequency O
in O
ovariectomized O
rats, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
chronic O
low O
levels O
of O
estradiol. O
Sulpiride O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
magnitude O
of O
a O
steroid-induced O
LH O
surge O
or O
the O
percentage O
of O
GnRH O
neurons O
activated O
during O
the O
surge. O
Estradiol O
is O
known O
to O
influence O
expression O
of O
the O
long O
form O
of O
prolactin O
receptors O
(PRL-R) O
and O
components O
of O
prolactin's O
signaling O
pathway. O
To O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
estrogen O
increases O
PRL-R O
expression O
and O
sensitivity O
to O
prolactin, O
we O
next O
demonstrated O
that O
estradiol O
greatly O
augments O
prolactin-induced O
STAT5 O
activation. O
Lastly, O
we O
measured O
PRL-R O
and O
suppressor O
of O
cytokine O
signaling O
(SOCS-1 O
and O
-3 O
and O
CIS, O
which O
reflect O
the O
level O
of O
prolactin O
signaling) O
mRNAs O
in O
response O
to O
sulpiride O
and O
estradiol. O
Sulpiride O
induced O
only O
SOCS-1 O
in O
the O
medial O
preoptic O
area, O
where O
GnRH O
neurons O
are O
regulated, O
but O
in O
the O
arcuate O
nucleus O
and O
choroid O
plexus, O
PRL-R, O
SOCS-3, O
and O
CIS O
mRNA O
levels O
were O
also O
induced. O
Estradiol O
enhanced O
these O
effects O
on O
SOCS-3 O
and O
CIS. O
Interestingly, O
estradiol O
also O
induced O
PRL-R, O
SOCS-3, O
and O
CIS O
mRNA O
levels O
independently. O
These O
data O
show O
that O
GnRH O
pulse O
frequency O
is O
inhibited O
by O
chronic O
hyperprolactinemia O
in O
a O
steroid-dependent O
manner. O
They O
also O
provide O
evidence O
for O
estradiol-dependent O
and O
brain O
region-specific O
regulation O
of O
PRL-R O
expression O
and O
signaling O
responses O
by O
prolactin. O

Estrogens O

ovariectomized O
rats O
from O
hippocampal B

induced O

(SE). O
We B
compared O
the O
effects O
of O
17beta-estradiol O
in O
adult O
male O
and O
ovariectomized O
female O
rats O
subjected O
to O
lithium-pilocarpine-induced O
SE. O
Rats O
received O
subcutaneous O
injections O
of O
17beta-estradiol O
(2 O
microg/rat) O
or O
oil O
once O
daily O
for O
four O
consecutive O
days. O
SE O
was O
induced O
20 O
h O
following O
the O
second O
injection O
and O
terminated O
3 O
h O
later. O
The O
extent O
of O
silver-stained O
CA3 O
and O
CA1 O
hippocampal O
neurons O
was O
evaluated O
2 O
days O
after O
SE. O
17beta-Estradiol O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
onset O
of O
first O
clonus O
in O
ovariectomized O
rats O
but O
accelerated O
it O
in O
males. O
17beta-Estradiol O
reduced O
the O
argyrophilic O
neurons O
in O
the O
CA1 O
and O
CA3-C O
sectors O
of O
ovariectomized O
rats. O
In O
males, O
estradiol O
increased O
the O
total O
damage O
score. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
estradiol O
on O
seizure B
threshold O
and O
damage O
may O
be O
altered O
by O
sex-related O
differences O
in O
the O
hormonal O
environment. O

schizophrenic B
or O
organic B
psychotic I
patients O
using O
concomitantly O
haloperidol, O
chlorpromazine O
or O
clozapine. O
This O
change O
resulted O
within O
2-4 O
weeks O
in O
the O
50-200% O
increase O
in O
the O
plasma O
levels O
of O
these O
neuroleptics O
and O
the O

None O
of O
the O
patients O
showed O
any O
clinical O
deteriotation O
during O
the O

3-6 O
months. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
case O
report O
support O
the O
idea O
that O
in O
contrast O
with O
carbamazepine O
oxcarbazepine O
does O
not O
induce O

were O
asked O
to O
quantify O
the O

after O
receiving O
standard O
lidocaine O
in O
one O

lidocaine O
in O
the O
opposite O
femoral O

The O
mean O

was O
significantly O
lower O
than O
the O

indicating O
that O
the O

CASE O
SUMMARY: O
A O
40-year-old O
woman O
with O
major B
depression I
took O
an O
overdose O
of O
venlafaxine O
in O
an O
apparent O
suicide O
attempt. O
After O
the O
ingestion O
of O
26 O
venlafaxine O
50-mg O
tablets, O
the O
patient O
experienced O
a O
witnessed O
generalized O
seizure. B
She O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
medical O
intensive O
care O
unit, O
venlafaxine O
was O
discontinued, O
and O
no O
further O
sequelae O
were O
seen. O
DISCUSSION: O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
venlafaxine O
overdose O
that O
resulted O
in O
a O
generalized O
seizure. O
Based O
on O
nonoverdose O
pharmacokinetics O
and O
pharmacodynamics O
of O
venlafaxine O
and O
the O
potential O
risks O
of O
available O
interventions, O
no O
emergent O
therapy O
was O
instituted. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
venlafaxine O
overdose O
in O
our O
patient O
resulted O
in O
a O
single O
episode O
of O
generalized O
seizure O
but O
elicited O
no O
further O
sequelae. O

Reduction O
in O
the O

resulted O
in O
the O

A O

She O
subsequently O
died O
some O
5 O
weeks O
after O
the O

It O
is O
thought O
that O
the O
clinico-pathological O

of O
this O
case O
bore O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
the O
so-called O

after O
the O
therapeutic O
administration O
of O
isoniazid. O
The O
administration O
of O
pharmacologic O
doses O
of O
pyridoxine O
hydrochloride O
led O
to O
a O
disappearance O
of O
symptoms. O
After O
discontinuing O
isoniazid O
therapy O
a O
similar O
pattern O
of O
behavior O
was O
noted O
that O
was O
controlled O
by O
pyridoxine. O
A O
placebo O
had O
no O
effect, O
but O
niacinamide O
was O
as O
effective O
as O
pyridoxine. O
Periodic O
withdrawal O
of O
pyridoxine O
was O
associated O
with O
return O
of O
the O
hyperkinesis. O

METHODS: O
The O

by O
Randall-Selitto. O
RESULTS: O
The O
results O
of O
this O
paper O
confirm O
that O
inhibition O
of O
bradykinin O
receptors O
and O
inducible O
NO O
synthase O
but O
not O
neuronal O
NO O

activity O
reduces O

Pretreatment O

It O
was O
also O
shown O
that O
both O
products O
of O

activation O
as O
well O
as O
bradykinin O
are O
involved O
in O

Moreover, O
L-NOArg O

intensify O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Results O
of O
these O
studies O
suggest O
that O
B1 O
and O
B2 O
receptors O
are O
engaged O
in O
transmission O
of O
nociceptive O
stimuli O
in O
both O
diabetic B
and I
toxic I
neuropathy. I
In O
streptozotocin-induced O
hyperalgesia, O
inducible O
NO O
synthase O
participates O
in O
pronociceptive O
activity O
of O
bradykinin, O
whereas O
in O
vincristine-induced O
hyperalgesia O
bradykinin O
seemed O
to O
activate O
neuronal O
NO O
synthase O
pathway. O
Therefore, O
concomitant O
administration O
of O
small O
doses O
of O
bradykinin O
receptor O
antagonists O
and O
NO O
synthase O
inhibitors O
can O
be O
effective O
in O
alleviation O
of O
neuropathic B
pain, I
even O
in O
hospital O
care. O

A O

The O

improved O
rapidly O
3 O
weeks O
after O

therapy O
of O
pegylated O
IFN O

therefore, O
we O
present O
this O

Sirolimus O
is O
a O
novel O
immunosuppressant O
with O
potent O
antiproliferative O
actions O
through O
its O
ability O
to O
inhibit O
the O
raptor-containing O
mammalian O
target O
of O
rapamycin O
protein O
kinase. O
Sirolimus O
represents O
a O
major O
therapeutic O
advance O
in O
the O
prevention O
of O
acute O
renal O
allograft O
rejection O
and O
chronic O
allograft O
nephropathy. B
Its O
role O
in O
the O
therapy O
of O
glomerulonephritis, B
autoimmunity, B
cystic B
renal I
diseases I
and O
renal B
cancer I
is O
under O
investigation. O
Because O
sirolimus O
does O
not O
share O
the O
vasomotor O
renal O
adverse O
effects O
exhibited O
by O
calcineurin O
inhibitors, O
it O
has O
been O
designated O
a O
'non-nephrotoxic O
drug'. B
However, O
clinical O
reports O
suggest O
that, O
under O
some O
circumstances, O
sirolimus O
is O
associated O
with O
proteinuria B
and O
acute B
renal I
dysfunction. I
A O
common O
risk O
factor O
appears O
to O
be O
presence O
of O
pre-existing O
chronic B
renal I
damage. I
The O
mechanisms O
of O
sirolimus-associated O
proteinuria O
are O
multifactorial O
and O
may O
be O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
glomerular O
capillary O
pressure O
following O
calcineurin O
inhibitor O
withdrawal. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
sirolimus O
directly O
causes O
increased O
glomerular O
permeability/injury, O
but O
evidence O
for O
this O
mechanism O
is O
currently O
inconclusive. O
The O
acute O
renal O
dysfunction O
associated O
with O
sirolimus O
(such O
as O
in O
delayed O
graft O
function) O
may O
be O
due O
to O
suppression O
of O
compensatory O
renal O
cell O
proliferation O
and O
survival/repair O
processes. O
Although O
these O
adverse O
effects O
occur O
in O
some O
patients, O
their O
occurrence O
could O
be O
minimised O
by O
knowledge O
of O
the O
molecular O
effects O
of O
sirolimus O
on O
the O
kidney, O
the O
use O
of O
sirolimus O
in O
appropriate O
patient O
populations, O
close O
monitoring O
of O
proteinuria O
and O
renal O
function, O
use O
of O
angiotensin-converting O
enzyme O
inhibitors O
or O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
blockers O
if O
proteinuria O
occurs O
and O
withdrawal O
if O
needed. O
Further O
long-term O
analysis O
of O
renal O
allograft O
studies O
using O
sirolimus O
as O
de O
novo O
immunosuppression O
along O
with O
clinical O
and O
laboratory O
studies O
will O
refine O
these O
issues O
in O
the O
future. O

AIM: O
This O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
to O
determine O
the O
effect O
of O
injection O
duration O
on O
bruising B
and O
pain B
following O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
subcutaneous O
injection O
of O
heparin. O
BACKGROUND: O
Although O
different O
methods O
to O
prevent O
bruising O
and O
pain O
following O
the O
subcutaneous O
injection O
of O
heparin O
have O
been O
widely O
studied O
and O
described, O
the O
effect O
of O
injection O
duration O
on O
the O
occurrence O
of O
bruising O
and O
pain O
is O
little O
documented. O
DESIGN: O
This O
study O
was O
designed O
as O
within-subject, O
quasi-experimental O
research. O
METHOD: O
The O
sample O
for O
the O
study O
consisted O
of O
50 O
patients O
to O
whom O
subcutaneous O
heparin O
was O
administered. O
Heparin O
was O
injected O
over O
10 O
seconds O
on O
the O
right O
abdominal O
site O
and O
30 O
seconds O
on O
the O
left O
abdominal O
site. O
Injections O
areas O
were O
assessed O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
bruising O
at O
48 O
and O
72 O
hours O
after O
each O
injection. O
Dimensions O
of O
the O
bruising O
on O
the O
heparin O
applied O
areas O
were O
measured O
using O
transparent O
millimetric O
measuring O
paper. O
The O
visual O
analog O
scale O
(VAS) O
was O
used O
to O
measure O
pain O
intensity O
and O
a O
stop-watch O
was O
used O
to O
time O
the O
pain O
period. O
Data O
were O
analysed O
using O
chi-square O
test, O
Mann-Whitney O
U, O
Wilcoxon O
signed O
ranks O
tests O
and O
correlation. O
RESULTS: O
The O
percentage O
of O
bruising O
occurrence O
was O
64% O
with O
the O
injection O
of O
10 O
seconds O
duration O
and O
42% O
in O
the O
30-second O
injection. O
It O
was O
determined O
that O
the O
size O
of O
the O
bruising O
was O
smaller O
in O
the O
30-second O
injection. O
Pain B
intensity O
and O
pain O
period O
were O
statistically O
significantly O
lower O
for O
the O
30-second O

RELEVANCE O
TO O
CLINICAL O
PRACTICE: O
When O

Tetrandrine O
(TET) O
and O
fangchinoline O
(FAN) O
are O
two O
naturally O
occurring O
analogues O
with O
a O
bisbenzylisoquinoline O
structure. O
The O
present O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
investigate O
the O
effects O
of O
TET O
and O
FAN O
on O
the O
experimental O
thrombosis B
induced O
by O
collagen O
plus O
epinephrine O
(EP) O
in O
mice, O
and O
platelet B

and O

coagulation I
in O

In O
the O
in O
vivo O
study, O
the O
administration O
(50 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.) O
of O
TET O
and O
FAN O
in O
mice O
showed O
the O
inhibition O
of O
thrombosis O
by O
55% O
and O
35%, O
respectively, O
while O
acetylsalicylic O
acid O
(ASA, O
50 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.), O
a O
positive O
control, O
showed O
only O
30% O
inhibition. O
In O
the O
vitro O
human O
platelet B
aggregations I
induced O
by O
the O
agonists O
used O
in O
tests, O
TET O
and O
FAN O
showed O
the O
inhibitions O
dose O
dependently. O
In O
addition, O
neither O
TET O
nor O
FAN O
showed O
any O
anticoagulation O
activities O
in O
the O
measurement O
of O
the O
activated O
partial O

time O
(APTT), O
prothrombin O
time O
(PT) O
and O
thrombin O
time O
(TT) O
using O
human-citrated O
plasma. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
antithrombosis O
of O
TET O
and O
FAN O
in O
mice O
may O
be O
mainly O
related O
to O
the O
antiplatelet O
aggregation O
activities. O

OBJECTIVE: O
This O
study O
was O
conducted O
to O
assess O
the O
occurrence O
of O
hepatic B
adverse I
effects I
encountered O
with O
antithyroid O
drugs. O
METHODS: O
Retrospective O
review O
of O
medical O
records O
of O
236 O
patients O
with O
hyperthyroidism B
admitted O
in O
our O
department O
(in- O
or O
out-patients) O
from O
1986 O
to O
1992. O
RESULTS: O
Four O
patients O
(1.7%) O
were O
identified O
with O
toxic B
hepatitis B
which O
could O
reasonably O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
use O
of O
antithyroid O
agent. O
Two O
patients O
had O
a O
cholestatic B
hepatitis I
induced O
by O
carbimazole O
(N O
omercazole). O
Two O
others O
had O
a O
mixed O
(cholestatic O
and O
cytolytic) O
hepatitis O
following O
carbimazole. O
One O
of O
the O
latter O
two O
patients O
further O
experienced O
a O
cytolytic O
hepatitis O
which O
appeared O
after O
Benzylthiouracil O
(Basd O
ne) O
had O
replaced O
carbimazole. O
Biological O
features O
of O
hepatitis O
disappeared O
in O
all O
cases O
after O
cessation O
of O
the O
incriminated O
drug, O
while O
biliary, O
viral O
and O
immunological O
searches O
were O
negative. O
Only O
2 O
patients O
of O
our O
retrospective O
study O
experienced O
a O
mild O
or O
severe O
neutropenia. B
CONCLUSION: O
Toxic B
hepatitis I
is O
a O
potential O
adverse O
effect O
of O
antithyroid O
drugs O
which O
warrants, O
as O
for O
haematological O
disturbances, O
a O
pre-therapeutic O
determination O
and O
a O
careful O
follow-up O
of O
relevant O
biological O
markers. O
Moreover, O
hepatotoxicity B
may O
not O
be O
restricted O
to O
one O
class O
of O
antithyroid O
agents. O

The O
marked O
vasodilator O
and O
negative O
inotropic O
effects O
of O
propofol O
are O
disadvantages O
in O
frail O
elderly O
patients. O
We O
investigated O
the O
safety O
and O
efficacy O
of O
adding O
different O
doses O
of O
ephedrine O
to O
propofol O
in O
order O
to O
obtund O
the O
hypotensive B
response. O
The O
haemodynamic O
effects O
of O
adding O
15, O
20 O
or O
25 O
mg O
of O
ephedrine O
to O
200 O
mg O
of O
propofol O
were O
compared O
to O
control O
in O
40 O
ASA O
3/4 O
patients O
over O
60 O
years O
presenting O
for O
genito-urinary O
surgery. O
The O
addition O
of O
ephedrine O
to O
propofol O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
effective O
method O
of O
obtunding O
the O
hypotensive O
response O
to O
propofol O
at O
all O
doses O
used O
in O
this O
study. O
However, O
marked O
tachycardia B
associated O
with O
the O
use O
of O
ephedrine O
in O
combination O
with O
propofol O
occurred O
in O
the O
majority O
of O
patients, O
occasionally O
reaching O
high O
levels O
in O
individual O
patients. O
Due O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
this O
tachycardia O
inducing O
myocardial B
ischemia, I
we O
would O
not O
recommend O
the O
use O
in O
elderly O
patients O
of O
any O
of O
the O
ephedrine/propofol/mixtures O
studied. O

Tamoxifen O
(TAM), O
the O
antiestrogenic O
drug O
most O
widely O
prescribed O
in O
the O
chemotherapy O
of O
breast B
cancer, I
induces O
changes O
in O
normal O
discoid O
shape O
of O
erythrocytes O
and O
hemolytic B
anemia. I
This O
work O
evaluates O
the O
effects O
of O
TAM O
on O
isolated O
human O
erythrocytes, O
attempting O
to O
identify O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
on O
TAM-induced O
hemolytic O
anemia O
and O
the O
involvement O
of O
biomembranes O
in O
its O
cytostatic O
action O
mechanisms. O
TAM O
induces O
hemolysis B
of O
erythrocytes O
as O
a O
function O
of O
concentration. O
The O
extension O
of O
hemolysis O
is O
variable O
with O
erythrocyte O
samples, O
but O
12.5 O
microM O
TAM O
induces O
total O
hemolysis O
of O
all O
tested O
suspensions. O
Despite O
inducing O
extensive O
erythrocyte O
lysis, O
TAM O
does O
not O
shift O
the O
osmotic O
fragility O
curves O
of O
erythrocytes. O
The O
hemolytic O
effect O
of O
TAM O
is O
prevented O
by O
low O
concentrations O
of O
alpha-tocopherol O
(alpha-T) O
and O
alpha-tocopherol O
acetate O
(alpha-TAc) O
(inactivated O
functional O
hydroxyl) O
indicating O
that O
TAM-induced O
hemolysis O
is O
not O
related O
to O
oxidative O
membrane O
damage. O
This O
was O
further O
evidenced O
by O
absence O
of O
oxygen O
consumption O
and O
hemoglobin O
oxidation O
both O
determined O
in O
parallel O
with O
TAM-induced O
hemolysis. O
Furthermore, O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
TAM O
inhibits O
the O
peroxidation O
of O
human O
erythrocytes O
induced O
by O
AAPH, O
thus O
ruling O
out O
TAM-induced O
cell O
oxidative O
stress. O
Hemolysis B
caused O
by O
TAM O
was O
not O
preceded O
by O
the O
leakage O
of O
K(+) O
from O
the O
cells, O
also O
excluding O
a O
colloid-osmotic O
type O
mechanism O
of O
hemolysis, O
according O
to O
the O
effects O
on O
osmotic O
fragility O
curves. O
However, O
TAM O
induces O
release O
of O
peripheral O
proteins O
of O
membrane-cytoskeleton O
and O
cytosol O
proteins O
essentially O
bound O
to O
band O
3. O
Either O
alpha-T O
or O
alpha-TAc O
increases O
membrane O
packing O
and O
prevents O
TAM O
partition O
into O
model O
membranes. O
These O
effects O
suggest O
that O
the O
protection O
from O
hemolysis O
by O
tocopherols O
is O
related O
to O
a O
decreased O
TAM O
incorporation O
in O
condensed O
membranes O
and O
the O
structural O
damage O
of O
the O
erythrocyte O
membrane O
is O
consequently O
avoided. O
Therefore, O
TAM-induced O
hemolysis O
results O
from O
a O
structural O
perturbation O
of O
red O
cell O
membrane, O
leading O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
erythrocyte O
membrane O
and O
its O
cytoskeleton O
caused O
by O
its O
high O
partition O
in O
the O
membrane. O
These O
defects O
explain O
the O
abnormal O
erythrocyte O
shape O
and O
decreased O
mechanical O
stability O
promoted O
by O
TAM, O
resulting O
in O
hemolytic O
anemia. O
Additionally, O
since O
membrane O
leakage O
is O
a O
final O
stage O
of O
cytotoxicity, O
the O
disruption O
of O
the O
structural O
characteristics O
of O
biomembranes O
by O
TAM O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
multiple O
mechanisms O
of O
its O
anticancer O
action. O

was O
to O
examine O
the O
safety O

efficacy O
of O
ketamine O
for O

supervised O
administration O
of O
the O
anesthetic, O

and O
the O
average O

Ninety-nine O
percent O
(sixty-eight) O
of O
the O
sixty-nine O
parents O
present O
during O

remained O
stable. O
Minor O
side O
effects O
included O
nausea B
(thirteen O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Ketamine O
reliably, O
safely, O
and O
quickly O
provided O
adequate O
sedation O
to O
effectively O
facilitate O
the O
reduction O
of O
children's O

Because O

On O

the O

was O
used O
to O

Simultaneous O
administration O
of O

resulted O
in O
a O

(P<0.05), O
suggesting O
the O
partial O
involvement O
of O
the O

In O

morphine O
inhibited O
the O
intestinal O

in O
48+/-4% O
and O
38+/-4% O
after O
acute O

chronic O
treatment, O
respectively, O
suggesting O
that O
tolerance O
did O
not O
develop O
to O
the O
constipating O
effects. O
The O
combination O
inhibited O
intestinal O
transit O
similar O
to O
that O
produced O
by O
morphine O
regardless O
of O
the O
time O
of O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
metamizol O
did O
not O
potentiate O
morphine-induced O

These O
findings O
show O
a O
significant O
interaction O
between O
morphine O
and O

this O

could O
be O

Previous O

Given O
that O

we O
hypothesized O

OBJECTIVE: O
Maternal O
tobacco O
smoking O
has O
negative O
effects O
on O
fetal O
growth. O
The O
influence O
of O
smoking O
during O
pregnancy O
on O
the O
developing O
cochlea O
has O
not O
been O
estimated, O
although O
smoking O
has O
been O
positively O
associated O
with O
hearing B
loss I
in O
adults. O
The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
effects O
of O
maternal O
smoking O
on O
transient O
evoked O
otoacoustic O
emissions O
(TEOAEs) O
of O
healthy O
neonates. O
METHODS: O
This O
study O
was O
undertaken O
as O
part O
of O
neonatal O
screening O
for O
hearing B
impairment I
and O
involved O
both O
ears O
of O
200 O
newborns. O
Newborns O
whose O
mothers O
reported O
smoking O
during O
pregnancy O
(n=200 O
ears) O
were O
compared O
to O
a O
control O
group O
of O
newborns O
(n=200 O
ears), O
whose O
mothers O
were O
non-smokers. O
Exposure O
to O
tobacco O
was O
characterized O
as O
low O
(<5 O
cigarettes O
per O
day, O
n=88 O
ears), O
moderate O
(5< O
or O
=cigarettes O
per O
day<10, O
n=76) O
or O
high O
(> O
or O
=10 O
cigarettes O
per O
day, O
n=36). O
RESULTS: O
In O
exposed O
neonates, O
TEOAEs O
mean O
response O
(across O
frequency) O
and O
mean O
amplitude O
at O
4000Hz O
was O
significantly O
lower O
than O
in O
non-exposed O
neonates. O
Comparisons O
between O
exposed O
newborns' O
subgroups O
revealed O
no O
significant O
differences. O
However, O
by O
comparing O
each O
subgroup O
to O
control O
group, O
we O
found O
statistically O
significant O
decreases B
of I
TEOAEs I
amplitudes I
at O
4000Hz O
for O
all O
three O
groups. O
Mean O
TEOAEs O
responses O
of O
highly O
exposed O
newborns O
were O
also O
significantly O
lower O
in O
comparison O
to O
our O
control O
group. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
utero, O
exposure O
to O
tobacco O
smoking O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
small O
impact O
on O
outer O
hair O
cells. O
These O
effects O
seem O
to O
be O
equally O
true O
for O
all O
exposed O
newborns, O
regardless O
of O
the O
degree O
of O
exposure. O
Further O
studies O
are O
needed O
in O
order O
to O
establish O
a O
potential O
negative O
effect O
of O
maternal O
smoking O
on O
the O
neonate's O
hearing O
acuity. O

Previous O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
repeated O
exposure O
of O
rats O
to O
the O
drug O
or O
to O
the O
experimental O
environment O
is O
necessary O
to O
observe O
nicotine-induced O
locomotor O
stimulation. O
In O
the O
present O
study O
the O
role O
of O
habituation O
to O
the O
experimental O
environment O
on O
the O
stimulant O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
in O
rats O
was O
examined. O
In O
addition, O
the O
role O
of O
dopamine O
receptors O
in O
mediating O
nicotine-induced O
locomotor O
stimulation O
was O
investigated O
by O
examining O
the O
effects O
of O
selective O
D1 O
and O
D2 O
dopamine O
receptor O
antagonists O
on O
activity O
induced O
by O
nicotine. O
Locomotor O
activity O
was O
assessed O
in O
male O
Sprague-Dawley O
rats O
tested O
in O
photocell O
cages. O
Nicotine O
(1.0 O
mg/kg) O
caused O
a O
significant O
increase B
in I
locomotor I
activity I
in O
rats O
that O
were O
habituated O
to O
the O
test O
environment, O
but O
had O
only O
a O
weak O
and O
delayed O
stimulant O
action O
in O
rats O
that O
were O
unfamiliar O
with O
the O
test O
environment. O
The O
stimulant O
action O
of O
nicotine O
was O
blocked O
by O
the O
central O
nicotinic O
antagonist O
mecamylamine O
but O
not O
by O
the O
peripheral O
nicotinic O
blocker O
hexamethonium, O
indicating O
that O
the O
response O
is O
probably O
mediated O
by O
central O
nicotinic O
receptors. O
Nicotine-induced O
hyperactivity B
was O
blocked O
by O
the O
selective O
D1 O
antagonist O
SCH O
23390, O
the O
selective O
D2 O
antagonist O
raclopride O
and O
the O
D1/D2 O
antagonist O
fluphenazine. O
Pretreatment O
with O
the O
D2 O
agonist O
PHNO O
enhanced O
nicotine-induced O
hyperactivity, O
whereas O
the O
D1 O
agonist O
SKF O
38393 O
had O
no O
effect. O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
acute O
nicotine O
injection O
induces O
a O
pronounced O
hyperactivity O
in O
rats O
habituated O
to O
the O
test O
environment. O
The O
effect O
appears O
to O
be O
mediated O
by O
central O
nicotine O
receptors, O
possibly O
located O
on O
dopaminergic O
neurons, O
and O
also O
requires O
the O
activation O
of O
both O
D1 O
and O
D2 O
dopamine O
receptors. O

RATIONALE: O
gamma-Vinyl O
GABA O
(GVG) O
irreversibly O
inhibits O
GABA-transaminase. O
This O
non-receptor O
mediated O
inhibition O
requires O
de O

for O

of O
functional O
GABA O
catabolism. O
OBJECTIVES: O
Given O
its O
preclinical O
success O
for O
treating O
substance B
abuse I
and O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
visual B
field I
defects I
(VFD) O
associated B
with O

we O
explored O
the O
effects O
of O
sub-chronic O
low O
dose O
GVG O
on O
cocaine-induced O
increases O
in O
nucleus O
accumbens O
(NAcc) O

(DA). O
METHODS: O
Using O
in O
vivo O
microdialysis, O
we O
compared O
acute O
exposure O
(450 O
mg/kg) O
to O
an O
identical O
sub-chronic O
exposure O
(150 O
mg/kg O
per O
day O
for O
3 O
days), O
followed O
by O
1- O
or O
3-day O
washout. O
Finally, O
we O
examined O
the O
low O
dose O
of O
150 O
mg/kg O
(50 O
mg/kg O
per O
day) O
using O
a O
similar O
washout O
period. O
RESULTS: O
Sub-chronic O
GVG O
exposure O
inhibited O
the O
effect O
of O
cocaine O
for O
3 O
days, O
which O
exceeded O
in O
magnitude O
and O
duration O
the O
identical O
acute O
dose. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Sub-chronic O
low O
dose O
GVG O
potentiates O
and O
extends O
the O
inhibition O
of O
cocaine-induced O
increases O
in O
dopamine, O
effectively O
reducing O
cumulative O
exposures O
and O
the O
risk O
for O
VFDS. O

present B
a O
major O
problem O
for O
the O
long-term O

(PD) O
patients. B
Due O
to O
the O

it O
is O
difficult O
to O
independently O
examine O
factors O
that O

Using O
macaque O

the O
current O

symptom O
severity, O
and O
response O
to O
and O
duration O
of O
levodopa O
therapy O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
development O

Monkeys O

levodopa O
administration. O
In O
contrast, O
monkeys O
with O

exposure, O
slow O
symptom O
progression O
and/or O
long O
symptom O
duration O
prior O
to O
initiation O
of O

were O
more O
resistant O
to O
developing O
LIDs O
(e.g., O
dyskinesia O
developed O
no O
sooner O
than O
146 O
days O

administration). O
All O
animals O
were O
similarly O
symptomatic O
at O
the O
start O
of O
levodopa O
treatment O
and O
had O
similar O
therapeutic O
responses O
to O
the O

These O
data O
suggest O
distinct O
differences O
in O
the O

develop O
LIDs O
in O
monkeys O
with O
different O
rates O
of O
symptom O

resulting O
in O
a O
femoral B
nerve I

Anticoagulant-induced O
femoral O
nerve O

represents O
the O
most O
common O
form O
of O

Trimipramine O
(TRI), O
which O
shows O
a O
clinical O
antidepressant O
activity, O
is O
chemically O
related O
to O
imipramine O
but O
does O
not O
inhibit O
the O
reuptake O
of O
noradrenaline O
and O
5-hydroxytryptamine, O
nor O
does O
it O
induce O
beta-adrenergic O
down-regulation. O
The O
mechanism O
of O
its O
antidepressant O
activity O
is O
still O
unknown. O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
TRI O
given O
repeatedly O
was O
able O
to O
induce O
adaptive O
changes O
in O
the O
dopaminergic O
and O
alpha1-adrenergic O
systems, O
demonstrated O
by O
us O
previously O
for O
various O
antidepressants. O
TRI O
was O
given O
to O
male O
Wistar O
rats O
and O
male O
Albino O
Swiss O
mice O
perorally O
twice O
daily O
for O
14 O
days. O
In O
the O
acute O
experiment O
TRI O
(given O
i.p.) O
does O
not O
antagonize O
the O
reserpine O
hypothermia B
in O
mice O
and O
does O
not O
potentiate O
the O
5-hydroxytryptophan O
head O
twitches O
in O
rats. O
TRI O
given O
repeatedly O
to O
rats O
increases O
the O
locomotor O
hyperactivity B
induced O
by O
d-amphetamine, O
quinpirole O
and O
(+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin O
(dopamine O
D2 O
and O
D3 O
effects). O
The O
stereotypies O
induced O
by O
d-amphetamine O
or O
apomorphine O
are O
not O
potentiated O
by O
TRI. O
It O
increases O
the O
behaviour O
stimulation O
evoked O
by O
phenylephrine O
(given O
intraventricularly) O
in O
rats, O
evaluated O
in O
the O
open O
field O
test O
as O
well O
as O
the O
aggressiveness B
evoked O
by O
clonidine O
in O
mice, O
both O
these O
effects O
being O
mediated O
by O
an O
alpha1-adrenergic O
receptor. O
It O
may O
be O
concluded O
that, O
like O
other O
tricyclic O
antidepressants O
studied O
previously, O
TRI O
given O
repeatedly O
increases O
the O
responsiveness O
of O
brain O
dopamine O
D2 O
and O
D3 O
(locomotor O
activity O
but O
not O
stereotypy) O
as O
well O
as O
alpha1-adrenergic O
receptors O
to O
their O
agonists. O
A O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
reuptake O
inhibition O
is O
of O
any O
importance O
to O
the O
adaptive O
changes O
induced O
by O
repeated O
antidepressants, O
suggested O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
antidepressant O
activity. O

and O
is O
also O
a O

(VTE) O
associated B
with O
CPA/EE O
compared O
with O

We O
believe O
the O
results O

may O
have O
been O

METHODS: O
Using O

RESULTS: O
The O

Here O
we O
show O
that O
perceived O

is O
decreased O
when O

is O
distracted O
away O
from O
the O

Furthermore, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
the O

in O

is O
very O
similar O
to O
that O

Our O
findings, O

suggest O
that O

BACKGROUND: O
Recent O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
transient B
neurologic I
symptoms I
(TNSs) O
frequently B
follow O
lidocaine O
spinal O
anesthesia O
but O
are O
infrequent O
with O
bupivacaine. O
However, O
identification O
of O
a O
short-acting O
local O
anesthetic O
to O
substitute O
for O
lidocaine O
for O
brief O
surgical O
procedures O
remains O
an O
important O
goal. O
Prilocaine O
is O
an O
amide O
local O
anesthetic O
with O
a O
duration O
of O
action O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
lidocaine. O
Accordingly, O
the O
present, O
prospective O
double-blind O
study O
compares O
prilocaine O
with O
lidocaine O
and O
bupivacaine O
with O
respect O
to O
duration O
of O
action O
and O
relative O
risk O
of O
TNSs. O
METHODS: O
Ninety O
patients O

in O
7.5% O

or O
0.5% O

All O

were O
provided O
in O

Details O
of O
spinal O

and O
regression O
of O

and O
the O
times O

criteria O
were O
noted. O
In O
the O
evening O
of O
postoperative O
day O
1, O
patients O
were O
evaluated O
for O
TNSs O
by O
a O
physician O
unaware O
of O
the O
drug O
administered O
and O
the O
details O
of O
the O
anesthetic O
procedure. O
RESULTS: O
Nine O
of O
30 O
patients O
receiving O
lidocaine O
experienced O
TNSs, O
1 O
of O
30 O
patients O
receiving O
prilocaine O
(P O
= O
0.03) O
had O
them, O
and O
none O
of O
30 O
patients O
receiving O
bupivacaine O
had O
TNSs. O
Times O
to O
ambulate O
and O
to O
void O
were O
similar O
after O
lidocaine O
and O
prilocaine O
(150 O
vs. O
165 O
min O
and O
238 O
vs. O
253 O
min, O
respectively) O
but O
prolonged O
after O
bupivacaine O
(200 O
and O
299 O
min, O
respectively; O
P O
< O
0.05). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Prilocaine O
may O
be O
preferable O
to O
lidocaine O
for O
short O
surgical O
procedures O
because O
it O
has O
a O
similar O
duration O
of O
action O
but O
a O
lower O
incidence O
of O
TNSs. O

than O
in O
Group O
C O
(5.6 O

P O

The O

lower O
in O
Group O
L O
(76.6%; O
P O

C O
(100%) O

not O
different O
from O
Group O
T O
(90%). O
The O
VAS O

correlated O
with O
the O
VAS O

(r O

0.7045; O
P O

similar: O

Assessing O
their O
overall O
satisfaction, O
89.7% O
would O
choose O

We O
conclude O
that O
lidocaine O
reduces O
the O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
propofol O
injection O
pain O
in O
ambulatory O

Many O
patients, O
however, O
develop O
negative O
long-term O
side O
effects O
such O
as O
premature B

We O
have O
previously O
demonstrated O
that O
ritonavir O

increases O
atherosclerotic B

formation O
in O
male O
mice O
to O
a O
greater O

Furthermore, O
peripheral O

isolated O
from O

In O
the O

study, O
we O
have O
investigated O
the O

We O
have O
utilized O
the O
human O
monocyte O
cell O
line, O
THP-1 O
as O
a O
model O
to O
address O
this O
question. O
Briefly, O
cells O
were O
differentiated O
for O
72 O
h O
with O
100 O

to O
obtain O
a O

Cells O
were O
then O
treated O
with O
30 O
ng/ml O
ritonavir O
or O
vehicle O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
aggregated O
LDL O
for O
24 O
h. O
Cell O
extracts O
were O
harvested, O
and O
lipid O
or O

RNA O
was O
isolated. O
E2 O
decreased O
the O
accumulation O
of O
cholesteryl O
esters O
in O
macrophages O
following O
ritonavir O
treatment. O
Ritonavir O
increased O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
scavenger O
receptor, O
CD36 O
mRNA, O
responsible O
for O
the O
uptake O
of O
LDL. O
Additionally, O
ritonavir O
treatment O
selectively O
increased O
the O
relative O
levels O
of O
PPARgamma O
mRNA, O
a O
transcription O
factor O
responsible O
for O
the O
regulation O
of O
CD36 O

expression. O
Treatment O
with O
E2, O
however, O
failed O
to O
prevent O
these O
increases O
at O
the O
mRNA O
level. O
E2 O
did, O
however, O
significantly O
suppress O
CD36 O
protein O
levels O
as O
measured O
by O
fluorescent O
immunocytochemistry. O
This O
data O
suggests O
that O
E2 O
modifies O
the O
expression O
of O
CD36 O
at O
the O
level O
of O

in O
monocyte-derived O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
changes O
in O
the O

calcitonin O
gene-related O
peptide O
(CGRP) O
concentration O
and O
platelet O
serotonin O
(5-hydroxytriptamine, O

content O
during O
the O

provoked O
by O

Fifteen O
female O

and O
eight O
controls O
participated O
in O
the O
study. O
Sublingual O
nitroglycerin O
(0.5 O
mg) O
was O
administered. O
Blood O
was O
collected O
from O
the O
antecubital O
vein O
four O
times: O
60 O
min O
before O
and O
after O
the O
nitroglycerin O
application, O
and O
60 O
and O
120 O
min O
after O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
migraine O
attack O
(mean O
344 O
and O
404 O
min; O
12 O
subjects). O
In O
those O
subjects O
who O
had O
no O
migraine O
attack O
(11 O
subjects) O
a O
similar O
time O
schedule O
was O
used. O
Plasma O
CGRP O
concentration O
increased O
significantly O
(P<0.01) O
during O
the O
migraine O
attack O
and O
returned O
to O
baseline O
after O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
migraine. O
In O
addition, O
both O
change O
and O
peak, O
showed O
significant O
positive O
correlations O
with O
migraine O
headache O
intensity O
(P<0.001). O
However, O
plasma O
CGRP O
concentrations O
failed O
to O
change O
during O
immediate O
headache O
and O
in O
the O
subjects O
with O
no O
migraine O
attack. O
Basal O
CGRP O
concentration O
was O
significantly O
higher O
and O
platelet O
5-HT O
content O
tended O
to O
be O
lower O
in O
subjects O
who O
experienced O
a O
migraine O
attack. O
Platelet O
serotonin O
content O
decreased O
significantly O
(P<0.01) O
after O
nitroglycerin O
in O
subjects O
with O
no O
migraine O
attack O
but O
no O
consistent O
change O
was O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
migraine O
attack. O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
fact O
that O
plasma O
CGRP O
concentration O
correlates O
with O
the O
timing O
and O
severity O
of O
a O
migraine O
headache O
suggests O
a O
direct O
relationship O
between O
CGRP O
and O
migraine. O
In O
contrast, O
serotonin O
release O
from O
platelets O
does O
not O
provoke O
migraine, O
it O
may O
even O
counteract O
the O
headache O
and O
the O
concomitant O
CGRP O
release O
in O
this O
model. O

These O

Zonisamide O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antiepileptic O
drug O
used O
to O
treat O
various O
types O
of O
seizures. B
Although O
visual B
hallucinations I
have O
not O
been O
reported O
as O
an O
adverse O
effect O
of O
this O
agent, O
we O
describe O
three O
patients O
who O
experienced O
complex O
visual O
hallucinations O
and O
altered O
mental O
status O
after O
zonisamide O
treatment O
was O
begun O
or O
its O
dosage O
increased. O
All O
three O
had O
been O
diagnosed O
earlier O
with O
epilepsy, B
and O
their O
electroencephalogram O
(EEG) O
findings O
were O
abnormal. O
During O
monitoring, O
visual O
hallucinations O
did O
not O
correlate O
with O
EEG O
readings, O
nor O
did O
video O
recording O
capture O
any O
of O
the O
described O
events. O
None O
of O
the O
patients O
had O
experienced O
visual O
hallucinations O
before O
this O
event. O
The O
only O
recent O
change O
in O
their O
treatment O
was O
the O
introduction O
or O
increased O
dosage O
of O
zonisamide. O
With O
either O
discontinuation O
or O
decreased O
dosage O
of O
the O
drug O
the O
symptoms O
disappeared O
and O
did O
not O
recur. O
Further O
observations O
and O
reports O
will O
help O
clarify O
this O
adverse O
effect. O
Until O
then, O
clinicians O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
this O
possible O
complication O
associated O
with O
zonisamide. O

Amnesia B
produced O
by O
scopolamine O
and O
cycloheximide O
were O
reversed O
by O
morphine O
given O
30 O
min O
before O
the O
test O
trial O
(pre-test), O
and O
pre-test O
morphine O
also O
facilitated O
the O

Similarly, O
pre-test O
scopolamine O
partially O
reversed O
the O

amnesia, B
but O
not O
significantly; O
and O
pre-test O
cycloheximide O
failed O
to O
reverse O
the O
cycloheximide-induced O
amnesia. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
facilitation O
of O
memory O
retrieval O
by O
pre-test O
morphine O
might O
be O
the O
direct O
action O
of O
morphine O
rather O

are O
the O
2 O
best-known O
members O
of O
the O
class O
of O
hypolipidaemic O
agents O
known O
as O
HMG O
CoA O

inhibitors. O
Clinical O
experience O
with O
lovastatin O
includes O
over O
5000 O
patients, O
700 O
of O
whom O
have O
been O
treated O
for O
2 O
years O
or O
more, O
and O
experience O
with O
simvastatin O
includes O
over O
3500 O
patients, O
of O
whom O
350 O
have O
been O
treated O
for O
18 O
months O
or O
more. O
Lovastatin O
has O
been O
marketed O
in O
the O
United O
States O
for O
over O
6 O
months. O
Both O
agents O
show O
substantial O
clinical O
efficacy, O
with O
reductions O
in O
total O
cholesterol O
of O
over O
30% O
and O
in O
LDL-cholesterol O
of O
40% O
in O
clinical O
studies. O
Modest O
increases O
in O
HDL-cholesterol O
levels O
of O
about O
10% O
are O
also O
reported. O
Clinical O
tolerability O
of O
both O
agents O
has O
been O
good, O
with O
fewer O
than O
3% O
of O
patients O
withdrawn O
from O
treatment O
because O
of O
clinical O
adverse O
experiences. O
Ophthalmological O
examinations O
in O
over O
1100 O
patients O
treated O
with O
one O
or O
the O
other O
agent O
have O
revealed O
no O
evidence O
of O
significant O
short O
term O
(up O
to O
2 O
years) O
cataractogenic O
potential. O
One O
to O
2% O
of O
patients O
have O
elevations O
of O
serum O
transaminases O
to O
greater O
than O
3 O
times O
the O
upper O
limit O

are O
asymptomatic O
and O

reported O
in O
about O
5% O

Myopathy, B
associated O
in O
some O
cases O

myoglobinuria, B
and O
in O
2 O
cases O

reported O
with O
lovastatin, O
especially O
in O
patients O
concomitantly O
treated O
with O
cyclosporin, O
gemfibrozil O
or O
niacin. O
Lovastatin O
and O
simvastatin O
are O
both O
effective O
and O
well-tolerated O
agents O
for O
lowering O
elevated O
levels O
of O
serum O
cholesterol. O
As O
wider O
use O
confirms O
their O
safety O
profile, O
they O
will O
gain O
increasing O
importance O
in O
the O
therapeutic O
approach O
to O
hypercholesterolaemia B
and O
its O
consequences. O

Cellular O
mechanisms O
which O
account O
for O
disruption O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
during O
acute O
hypertension B
are O
not O
clear. O
The O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
role O
of O
synthesis/release O
of O
bradykinin O
to O
activate O
B2 O
receptors O
in O
disruption O
of O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
during O
acute O
hypertension. O
Permeability O
of O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
was O
quantitated O
by O
clearance O
of O
fluorescent-labeled O
dextran O
before O
and O
during O
phenylephrine-induced O
acute O
hypertension O
in O
rats O
treated O
with O
vehicle O
and O
Hoe-140 O
(0.1 O
microM). O
Phenylephrine O
infusion O
increased O
arterial O
pressure, O
arteriolar O
diameter O
and O
clearance O
of O
fluorescent O
dextran O
by O
a O
similar O
magnitude O
in O
both O
groups. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
disruption O
of O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
during O
acute O
hypertension O
is O
not O
related O
to O
the O
synthesis/release O
of O
bradykinin O
to O
activate O
B2 O
receptors. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
ceftriaxone O
leads O
to O
pseudolithiasis B
in O
some O
patients. O
Clinical O
and O
experimental O
studies O
also O
suggest O
that O
situations O
causing O
gallbladder B
dysfunction, I
such O
as O
fasting, O
may O
have O
a O
role O
for O
the O
development O
of O
pseudolithiasis. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
prospectively O
evaluated O
the O
incidence O
and O
clinical O
importance O
of O
pseudolithiasis O
in O
paediatric O
surgical O
patients O
receiving O
ceftriaxone O
treatment, O
who O
often O
had O
to O
fast O
in O
the O
post-operative O
period. O
Fifty O
children O
who O
were O
given O
ceftriaxone O
were O
evaluated O
by O
serial O
abdominal O
sonograms. O
Of O
those, O
13 O
(26%) O
developed O
biliary O
pathology. O
Comparison O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
or O
without O
pseudolithiasis O
revealed O
no O
significant O
difference O
with O
respect O
to O
age, O
sex, O
duration O
of O
the O
treatment O
and O
starvation O
variables. O
After O
cessation O
of O
the O
treatment, O
pseudolithiasis O
resolved O
spontaneously O
within O
a O
short O
period. O
The O
incidence O
of O
pseudolithiasis O
is O
not O
affected O
by O
fasting. O

OBJECTIVES: O
Thrombotic B

biopsies O
(n=25) O
performed O
during O
this O
interval. O
Pre- O

posttransplant O
crossmatching O
was O
done O
when O
possible. O
RESULTS: O
Five O
cases O
of O
thrombotic O
microangiopathy O
were O
found. O
Three O
of O
these O
cases O
were O
from O
the O
25 O
transplantations O
performed O
at O
King O
Fahad O
National O
Guard O
Hospital, O
while O
the O
other O
2 O
transplantations O
had O
been O
performed O
abroad O
and O
were O
referred O
to O
us O
for O
follow-up. O
Three O
cases O
were O
related O
to O
cyclosporine, O
and O
1 O
case O
was O
secondary O
to O
both O
cyclosporine O
and O
tacrolimus. O
The O
fifth O
case O
had O
features O
of O
thrombotic O
microangiopathy O
related O
to O
an O
antiphospholipid B
syndrome I
in O
a O
patient O
with O
systemic B
lupus I
erythematosus. I
CONCLUSIONS: O
In O
the O
literature, O
the O
most-frequent O
cause O
of O
hemolytic O
uremic O
syndrome O
in O
patients O
following O
renal O
transplantation O
is O
recurrence O
of O
the O
hemolytic O
uremic O
syndrome. O
Other O
causes O
include O
drug-related O
(cyclosporine, O
tacrolimus) O
toxicity, B
procoagulant O
status, O
and O
antibody-mediated O
rejection. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
most-frequent O
cause O
of O
thrombotic O
microangiopathy O
was O
drug O
related, O
secondary O
mainly O
to O
cyclosporine. O
In O
the O
current O
study, O
the O
frequency O
of O
thrombotic O
microangiopathy O
was O
similar O
to O
the O
percentage O
reported O
in O
the O
literature O
(20%). O

A O
case O
is O
presented O
of O
a O
reversible O
intra-Hisian B
block I
occurring O
under O
amiodarone O
treatment O
for O
atrial B
tachycardia I
in O
a O
patient O
without O
clear O
intraventricular B
conduction I
abnormalities. I
His O
bundle O
recordings O
showed O
an O
atrial O
tachycardia O
with O
intermittent O
exit O
block O
and O
greatly O
prolonged O
BH O
and O
HV O
intervals O
(40 O
and O
100 O
msec, O
respectively). O
Thirty O
days O
after O
amiodarone O
discontinuation, O
His O
bundle O
electrograms O
showed O
atrial B
flutter I
without O
intra-Hisian O
or O
infra-Hisian O
delay. O
Amiodarone O
should O
be O
used O
with O
caution O
during O
long-term O
oral O
therapy O
in O
patients O
with O
or O
without O
clear O
intraventricular O
conduction O
defects. O

Haematological O
adverse O
reactions O
associated O
with O
fatal O
outcome O
are O
rare O
during O
treatment O
with O
ciprofloxacin. O
A O
30-year O
old O
Caucasian O
man O
reported O
with O
abdominal B
pain I
and O
jaundice B
after O
3-day O
administration O
of O
oral O
ciprofloxacin O
for O
a O
suspect O
of O
urinary B
tract I
infection. I
Clinical O
evaluations O
suggested O
an O
initial O
diagnosis O
of O
severe O
thrombocytopenia B
and O
haemolysis. B
The O
patient O
progressively O
developed O
petechiae B
and O
purpura B
on O
thorax O
and O
lower O
limbs. O
Despite O
pharmacological O
and O
supportive O
interventions, O
laboratory O
parameters O
worsened O
and O
the O
patient O
died O
17 O
hours O
after O
admission. O
An O
accurate O
autopsy O
revealed O
most O
organs O
with O
diffuse O
petechial O
haemorrhages. B
No O
signs O
of O
bone B
marrow I
depression I
were O
found. O
No O
thrombi B
or O
signs O
of O
microangiopathies B
were O
observed O
in O
arterial O
vessels. O
Blood O
and O
urine O
cultures O
did O
not O
show O
any O
bacterial O
growth. O
This O
case O
report O
shows O
that O
ciprofloxacin O
may O
precipitate O
life-threatening O
thrombocytopenia O
and O
haemolytic B
anaemia, I
even O
in O
the O
early O
phases O
of O
treatment O
and O
without O
apparent O
previous O
exposures. O

Previous O
research O
in O
this O
laboratory O
has O
shown O
that O
a O
diet O
of O
intermittent O
excessive O
sugar O
consumption O
produces O
a O
state O
with O
neurochemical O
and O
behavioral O
similarities O
to O
drug B
dependency. I
The O
present O
study O
examined O
whether O
female O
rats O
on O
various O
regimens O
of O
sugar O
access O
would O
show O
behavioral B
cross-sensitization I
to O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
amphetamine. O
After O
a O
30-min O
baseline O
measure O
of O
locomotor O
activity O
(day O
0), O
animals O
were O
maintained O
on O
a O
cyclic O
diet O
of O
12-h O
deprivation O
followed O
by O
12-h O
access O
to O
10% O
sucrose O
solution O
and O
chow O
pellets O
(12 O
h O
access O
starting O
4 O
h O
after O
onset O
of O
the O
dark O
period) O
for O
21 O
days. O
Locomotor O
activity O
was O
measured O
again O
for O
30 O
min O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
days O
1 O
and O
21 O
of O
sugar O
access. O
Beginning O
on O
day O
22, O
all O
rats O
were O
maintained O
on O
ad O
libitum O
chow. O
Nine O
days O
later O
locomotor O
activity O
was O
measured O
in O
response O
to O
a O
single O
low O
dose O
of O
amphetamine O
(0.5 O
mg/kg). O
The O
animals O
that O
had O
experienced O
cyclic O
sucrose O
and O
chow O
were O
hyperactive B
in O
response O
to O
amphetamine O
compared O
with O
four O
control O
groups O
(ad O
libitum O
10% O
sucrose O
and O
chow O
followed O
by O
amphetamine O
injection, O
cyclic O
chow O
followed O
by O
amphetamine O
injection, O
ad O
libitum O
chow O
with O
amphetamine, O
or O
cyclic O
10% O
sucrose O
and O
chow O
with O
a O
saline O
injection). O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
a O
diet O
comprised O
of O
alternating O
deprivation O
and O
access O
to O
a O
sugar O
solution O
and O
chow O
produces O
bingeing O
on O
sugar O
that O
leads O
to O
a O
long O
lasting O
state O
of O
increased O
sensitivity O
to O
amphetamine, O
possibly O
due O
to O
a O
lasting O
alteration O
in O
the O
dopamine O
system. O

Statins O
can O
cause O
a O
necrotizing O
myopathy B
and O
hyperCKaemia B
which O
is O
reversible O
on O
cessation O
of O
the O
drug. O
What O
is O
less O
well O
known O
is O
a O
phenomenon O
whereby O
statins O
may O
induce O
a O
myopathy, O
which O
persists O
or O
may O
progress O
after O
stopping O
the O
drug. O
We O
investigated O
the O
muscle O
pathology O
in O
8 O
such O
cases. O
All O
had O
myofibre O
necrosis B
but O
only O
3 O
had O
an O
inflammatory O
infiltrate. O
In O
all O
cases O
there O
was O
diffuse O
or O
multifocal O
up-regulation O
of O
MHC-I O
expression O
even O
in O
non-necrotic O
fibres. B
Progressive O
improvement O
occurred O
in O
7 O
cases O
after O
commencement O
of O
prednisolone O
and O
methotrexate, O
and O
in O
one O
case O
spontaneously. O
These O
observations O
suggest O
that O
statins O
may O
initiate O
an O
immune-mediated O
myopathy O
that O
persists O
after O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
drug O
and O
responds O
to O
immunosuppressive O
therapy. O
The O
mechanism O
of O
this O
myopathy O
is O
uncertain O
but O
may O
involve O
the O
induction O
by O
statins O
of O
an O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
stress O
response O
with O
associated O
up-regulation O
of O
MHC-I O
expression O
and O
antigen O
presentation O
by O
muscle O
fibres. O

Atypical B
sensations I
following O
the O

of O
subcutaneous O
sumatriptan O
are O
common, O
but O
of O
uncertain O
origin. O
They O
are O
almost O
always O
benign, O
but O
can O
be O
mistaken O
for O
a O
serious O
adverse O
event O
by O
the O
patient. O
Two O
patients O
are O
presented O
with O
tingling B
or I
burning I
sensations I
limited O
to O
areas O
of O

In O
these O

most O

generated O
superficially O

The O
effect O

on O
the O
toxic O
action O
of O
an O
acute O
or O
chronic O
treatment O
with O
adriamycin O
(ADR) O
was O
evaluated O
in O
mice. O
PEG O
400 O
impressively O
decreased O
both O
acute O
high-dose O
and O
chronic O
low-dose-ADR-associated O
lethality. O
Light O
microscopic O
analysis O
showed O
a O
significant O
protection O
against O
ADR-induced O
cardiac B
morphological I
alterations. I
Such O
treatment O
did O
not O
diminish O
the O
ADR O
antitumor O
activity O
in O
L1210 B
leukemia I
and O
in O
Ehrlich B

tumor. I

Twenty-three O
hours O
after O
heart O
transplantation, O
life-threatening O
acute O
right B
heart I
failure I
was O
diagnosed O
in O
a O
patient O
requiring O
continuous O
venovenous O
hemodiafiltration O
(CVVHDF). O
Increasing O
doses O
of O
catecholamines, O
sedatives, O
and O
muscle O
relaxants O
administered O
through O
a O
central O
venous O
catheter O
were O
ineffective. O
However, O
a O
bolus O
of O
epinephrine O
injected O
through O
an O
alternative O
catheter O
provoked O
a O
hypertensive B
crisis. O
Thus, O
interference O
with O
the O
central O
venous O
infusion O
by O
the O
dialysis O
catheter O
was O
suspected. O
The O
catheters O
were O
changed, O
and O
hemodynamics O
stabilized O
at O
lower O
catecholamine O
doses. O
When O
the O
effects O
of O
IV O
drugs O
are O
inadequate O
in O
patients O
receiving O
CVVHDF, O
interference O
with O
adjacent O
catheters O
resulting O
in O
elimination O
of O
the O
drug O
by O
CVVHDF O
should O
be O
suspected. O

In O
this O

we O
investigated O
the O
therapeutic O

mononuclear O
cells O
(BMCs) O
in O
a O

BMCs O
obtained O
from O

were O
transplanted O
intravenously O
after O

status B
epilepticus B
(SE). O
Spontaneous B
recurrent I
seizures B
(SRS) O
were B
monitored O
using O

All O
of O
the O
rats O
in O
the O
saline-treated O
epileptic O
control O
group O
developed O
SRS, O
whereas O
none O
of O
the O
BMC-treated O
epileptic O
animals O
had O
seizures O
in O
the O
short O
term O
(15 O
days O
after O

regardless O
of O
the O
BMC O
source. O
Over O
the O
long-term O
chronic O
phase O
(120 O
days O
after O

only O
25% O
of O
BMC-treated O
epileptic O
animals O
had O
seizures, O
but O
with O
a O
lower O
frequency O

The O
density O
of O
hippocampal O

in O
the O
brains O
of O
animals O
treated O
with O

was O
markedly O
preserved. O
At O

long-term O

was O
preserved O
in O
BMC-transplanted O

The O
donor-derived O

In O
conclusion, O
treatment O
with O
BMCs O
can O
prevent O
the O
development O
of O
chronic O
seizures, O
reduce O

A O

of O
an O
over-the-counter O
analgesic O
containing O
sodium O
acetylsalicylate, O
caffeine, O

no O
significant O
CNS O
stimulation O
despite O
the O
presence O
of O
175 O
micrograms O
of O

Because O
salicylates O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
augment O
the O
stimulatory O
effects O
of O
caffeine O
on O
the O
CNS, O
attention O
was O
focused O
on O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
acetaminophen O
(52 O
micrograms/mL) O
reduced O
the O
CNS O
toxicity B
of O
caffeine. O
Studies O
in O
DBA/2J O
mice O
showed O
that: O
1) O
pretreatment O
with O
acetaminophen O
(100 O
mg/kg) O
increased O
the O
interval O
between O
the O
administration O
of O
caffeine O
(300 O
to O
450 O
mg/kg O
IP) O
and O
the O
onset O
of O
fatal O
convulsions B
by O
a O
factor O
of O
about O
two; O
and O
2) O
pretreatment O
with O
acetaminophen O
(75 O
mg/kg) O
reduced O
the O
incidence O
of O
audiogenic O
seizures B
produced O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
caffeine O
(12.5 O

The O
frequency O
of O
sound-induced O
seizures O
after O
12.5 O
or O
25 O
mg/kg O
caffeine O
was O
reduced O
from O
50 O
to O
5% O
by O
acetaminophen. O
In O
the O
absence O
of O
caffeine, O
acetaminophen O
(up O
to O
300 O
mg/kg) O
did O
not O
modify O
the O
seizures O
induced O
by O
maximal O
electroshock O
and O

not O
alter O
the O
convulsant O
dose O

pentylenetetrezol O
in O
mice O
(tests O
performed O
by O
the O
Anticonvulsant O
Screening O
Project O

Acetaminophen O
(up O

did O
not O
retard O
the O
incorporation O
of O
radioactive O
adenosine O
into O

Thus O
the O
mechanism O
by O

remains O
unknown. O

Sensori-motor B

was I
the O
commonest O

(50%). O
Guillain-Barr B

was O
the O
commonest O
identifiable O
cause O
(15.6%), O
accounting O

the O
cases O

and O
pathogenesis O
of O
the O
neuropathies B
are O
briefly O
discussed. O

A O
case O
is O
reported O
of O
the O
hemolytic B
uremic I
syndrome I
(HUS) O
in B
a O
woman O
taking O
oral O
contraceptives. O
She O
was O
treated O
with O
heparin, O
dipyridamole O
and O
hemodialysis; O
and O
after O
more O
than O
three O
months, O
her O
urinary O
output O
rose O
above O
500 O
ml; O
and O
six O
months O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
anuria, B
dialysis O
treatment O
was O
stopped. O
This O
case O
emphasizes O
the O
possibility O
that O
HUS O
in O
adults O
is O
not O
invariably O
irreversible O
and O
that, O
despite O
prolonged O
oliguria, B
recovery O
of O
renal O
function O
can O
be O
obtained. O
Therefore, O
in O
adult O
patients O
affected O
by O
HUS, O
dialysis O
should O
not O
be O
discontinued O
prematurely; O
moreover, O
bilateral O
nephrectomy, O
for O
treatment O
of O
severe O
hypertension B
and O
microangiopathic B
hemolytic I
anemia, I
should O
be O
performed O
with O
caution. O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
widespread O
use O
of O
benzodiazepines O
has O
led O
to O
increasing O
recognition O
of O
their O
unwanted O
effects. O
The O
efficacy O
of O
alprazolam O
and O
placebo O
in O
panic B
disorder I
with O
agoraphobia, B
and O
the O
side-effect O
and O
adverse O
effect O
profiles O
of O
both O
drug O
groups O
were O
measured. O
METHOD: O
In O
London O
and O
Toronto O
154 O
patients O
who O
met O
DSM-III O
criteria O
for O
panic O
disorder O
with O
agoraphobia O
were O
randomised O
to O
alprazolam O
or O
placebo. O
Subjects O
in O
each O
drug O
group O
also O
received O
either O
exposure O
or O
relaxation. O
Treatment O
was O
from O
weeks O
0 O
to O
8 O
and O
was O
then O
tapered O
from O
weeks O
8 O
to O
16. O
RESULTS: O
Mean O
alprazolam O
dose O
was O
5 O
mg O
daily. O
Compared O
with O
placebo O
subjects, O
alprazolam O
patients O
developed O
more O
adverse O
reactions O
(21% O
v. O
0%) O
of O
depression, B
enuresis, B
disinhibition O
and O
aggression; B
and O
more O
side-effects, O
particularly O
sedation, O
irritability, B
impaired B
memory, I
weight B
loss I
and O
ataxia. B
Side-effects O
tended O
to O
diminish O
during O
treatment O
but O
remained O
significant O
at O
week O
8. O
Despite O
this, O
the O
drop-out O
rate O
was O
low. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Alprazolam O
caused O
side-effects O
and O
adverse O
effects O
during O
treatment O
but O
many O
patients O
were O
willing O
to O
accept O
these. O

A O
patient O
who O
received O
antithymocyte O
globulin O
therapy O
for O
aplastic B
anemia I
due O
to O
D-penicillamine O
therapy O
is O
described. O
Bone O
marrow O
recovery O
and O
peripheral O
blood O
recovery O
were O
complete O
1 O
month O
and O
3 O
months, O
respectively, O
after O
treatment, O
and O
blood O
transfusion O
or O
other O
therapies O
were O
not O
necessary O
in O
a O
follow-up O
period O
of O
more O
than O
2 O
years. O
Use O
of O
antithymocyte O
globulin O
may O
be O
the O
optimal O
treatment O
of O
D-penicillamine-induced O
aplastic O
anemia. O

BACKGROUND/AIMS: O
It O
is O
still O
unclear O
what O
happens O
in O
the O
glomerulus O
when O
proteinuria B
starts. O
Using O
puromycin O
aminonucleoside O
nephrosis B
(PAN) O
rats, O
we O
studied O
early O
ultrastructural O
and O
permeability O
changes O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
podocyte-associated O
molecules O
nephrin, O
a-actinin, O
dendrin, O
and O
plekhh2, O
the O
last O
two O
of O
which O
were O
only O
recently O
discovered O
in O
podocytes. O
METHODS: O
Using O
immune O
stainings, O
semiquantitative O
measurement O
was O
performed O
under O
the O
electron O
microscope. O
Permeability O
was O
assessed O
using O
isolated O
kidney O
perfusion O
with O
tracers. O
Possible O
effects O
of O
ACE O
inhibition O
were O
tested. O
RESULTS: O
By O
day O
2, O
some O
patchy O
foot O
process O
effacement, O
but O
no O
proteinuria, O
appeared. O
The O
amount O
of O
nephrin O
was O
reduced O
in O
both O
diseased O
and O
normal O
areas. O
The O
other O
proteins O
showed O
few O
changes, O
which O
were O
limited O
to O
diseased O
areas. O
By O
day O
4, O
foot O
process O
effacement O
was O
complete O
and O
proteinuria O
appeared O
in O
parallel O
with O
signs O
of O
size O
barrier O
damage. O
Nephrin O
decreased O
further, O
while O
dendrin O
and O
plekhh2 O
also O
decreased O
but O
a-actinin O
remained O
unchanged. O
ACE O
inhibition O
had O
no O
significant O
protective O
effect. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
PAN O
glomeruli O
already O
showed O
significant O
pathology O
by O
day O
4, O
despite O
relatively O
mild O
proteinuria. O
This O
was O
preceded O
by O
altered O
nephrin O
expression, O
supporting O
its O
pivotal O
role O
in O
podocyte O
morphology. O
The O
novel O
proteins O
dendrin O
and O
plekhh2 O
were O
both O
reduced, O
suggesting O
roles O
in O
PAN, O
whereas O
a-actinin O
was O
unchanged. O

OBJECTIVE: O
A O
case O
of O
acute O
myocarditis B
associated O
with O
the O
commencement O
of O
clozapine O
is O
described, O
highlighting O
the O
onset, O
course O
and O
possible O
contributing O
factors. O
There O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
raise O
awareness O
about O
this O
potentially O
fatal O
complication O
of O
clozapine O
use. O
RESULTS: O
A O
20-year-old O
male O
with O
schizophrenia B
developed O
a O
sudden O
onset O
of O
myocarditis O
after O
commencement O
of O
clozapine. O
The O
patient O
recovered O
with O
intensive O
medical O
support. O
The O
symptoms O
occurred O
around O
2 O
weeks O
after O
starting O
clozapine O
in O
an O
inpatient O
setting. O
Possible O
contributing O
factors O
may O
have O
been O
concomitant O
antidepressant O
use O
and O
unaccustomed O
physical O
activity. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Myocarditis B
is O
an O
increasingly O
recognized O
complication O
associated O
with O
the O
use O
of O
clozapine. O
It O
can O
be O
fatal O
if O
not O
recognized O
and O
treated O
early. O
Considering O
that O
clozapine O
remains O
the O
gold O
standard O
in O
treatment O
of O
resistant O
psychosis, B
there O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
raise O
awareness O
among O
medical O
and O
paramedical O
staff O
involved O
in O
the O
care O
of O
these O
patients. O
There O
are O
also O
implications O
for O
recommendations O
and O
regulations O
regarding O
the O
use O
of O
clozapine. O

Rats O
with O
lithium-induced O
nephropathy B
were O
subjected O
to O
high O
protein O
(HP) O
feeding, O
uninephrectomy O
(NX) O
or O
a O
combination O
of O
these, O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
induce O
glomerular O
hyperfiltration O
and O
further O
progression O
of O
renal B
failure. I
Newborn O
female O
Wistar O
rats O
were O
fed O
a O
lithium-containing O
diet O
(50 O
mmol/kg) O
for O
8 O
weeks O
and O
then O
randomized O
to O
normal O
diet, O
HP O
diet O
(40 O
vs. O
19%), O
NX O
or O
HP+NX O
for O
another O
8 O
weeks. O
Corresponding O
non-lithium O
pretreated O
groups O
were O
generated. O
When O
comparing O
all O
lithium O
treated O
versus O
non-lithium-treated O
groups, O
lithium O
caused O
a O
reduction O
in O
glomerular O
filtration O
rate O
(GFR) O
without O
significant O
changes O
in O
effective O
renal O
plasma O
flow O
(as O
determined O
by O
a O
marker O
secreted O
into O
the O
proximal O
tubules) O
or O
lithium O
clearance. O
Consequently, O
lithium O
pretreatment O
caused O
a O
fall O
in O
filtration O
fraction O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
fractional O
Li O
excretion. O
Lithium O
also O
caused O
proteinuria B
and O
systolic O
hypertension B
in O
absence O
of O
glomerulosclerosis. B
HP O
failed O
to O
accentuante O
progression O
of O
renal O
failure O
and O
in O
fact O
tended O
to O
increase O
GFR O
and O
decrease O
plasma O
creatinine O
levels O
in O
lithium O
pretreated O
rats. O
NX O
caused O
an O
additive O
deterioration O
in O
GFR O
which, O
however, O
was O
ameliorated O
by O
HP. O
NX+HP O
caused O
a O
further O
rise O
in O
blood O
pressure O
in O
Li-pretreated O
rats. O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
Li-induced O
nephropathy, O
even O
when O
the O
GFR O
is O
only O
modestly O
reduced, O
is O
associated O
with O
proteinuria O
and O
arterial O
systolic O
hypertension. O
In O
this O
model O
of O
chronic B
renal I
failure I
the O
decline O
in O
GFR O
is O
not O
accompanied O
by O
a O
corresponding O
fall O
in O
effective O
renal O
plasma O
flow, O
which O
may O
be O
the O
functional O
expression O
of O
the O
formation O
of O
nonfiltrating O
atubular O
glomeruli. O
The O
fractional O
reabsorption O
of O
tubular O
fluid O
by O
the O
proximal O
tubules O
is O
reduced, O
leaving O
the O
distal O

who O

were O
found O
to O
have O

In O
the O

the O

In O
the O

The O

Despite O

It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
bromocriptine-induced O
tachycardia, B
which O
persisted O
after O
adrenalectomy, O
is O
(i) O
mediated O
by O
central O
dopamine O
D2 O
receptor O
activation O
and O
(ii) O
reduced O
by O
5-day O
isoproterenol O
pretreatment, O
supporting O
therefore O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
this O
effect O
is O
dependent O
on O
sympathetic O
outflow O
to O
the O
heart. O
This O
study O
was O
conducted O
to O
examine O
whether O
prolonged O
pretreatment O
with O
isoproterenol O
could O
abolish O
bromocriptine-induced O
tachycardia O
in O
conscious O
rats. O
Isoproterenol O
pretreatment O
for O
15 O
days O
caused O
cardiac B
hypertrophy I
without O
affecting O
baseline O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate. O
In O
control O
rats, O
intravenous O
bromocriptine O
(150 O
microg/kg) O
induced O
significant O
hypotension B
and O
tachycardia. O
Bromocriptine-induced O
hypotension O
was O
unaffected O
by O
isoproterenol O
pretreatment, O
while O
tachycardia O
was O
reversed O
to O
significant O
bradycardia, B
an O
effect O
that O
was O
partly O
reduced O
by O
i.v. O
domperidone O
(0.5 O
mg/kg). O
Neither O
cardiac O
vagal O
nor O
sympathetic O
tone O
was O
altered O
by O
isoproterenol O
pretreatment. O
In O
isolated O
perfused O
heart O
preparations O
from O
isoproterenol-pretreated O
rats, O
the O
isoproterenol-induced O
maximal O
increase O
in O
left O
ventricular O
systolic O
pressure O
was O
significantly O
reduced, O
compared O
with O
saline-pretreated O
rats O
(the O
EC50 O
of O
the O
isoproterenol-induced O
increase O
in O
left O
ventricular O
systolic O
pressure O
was O
enhanced O
approximately O
22-fold). O
These O
results O
show O
that O
15-day O
isoproterenol O
pretreatment O
not O
only O
abolished O
but O
reversed O
bromocriptine-induced O
tachycardia O
to O
bradycardia, O
an O
effect O
that O
is O
mainly O
related O

cardiac O
beta-adrenoceptor O

suggest O
that, O
in O

the O

this O

The O
effect O
of O
humoral O
modulators O
on O
the O
morphine-induced O
increase B

activity I
of O
mice O
was O
studied. O
The O
subcutaneous O
administration O
of O
10 O
mg/kg O
of O
morphine-HC1 O
produced O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
locomotor O
activity O
in O
mice. O
The O
morphine-induced O
hyperactivity B
was O
potentiated O
by O
scopolamine O
and O
attenuated O
by O
physostigmine. O
In O
contrast, O
both O
methscopolamine O
and O
neostigmine, O
which O
do O
not O
penetrate O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier, O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
the O
hyperactivity O
produced O
by O
morphine. O
Pretreatment O
of O
mice O
with O
alpha-methyltyrosine O
(20 O
mg/kg O
i.p., O
one O
hour), O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
tyrosine O
hydroxylase, O
significantly O
decreased O
the O
activity-increasing O
effects O
of O
morphine. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
pretreatment O
with O
p-chlorophenylalamine O
(3 O
X O
320 O
mg/kg O
i.p., O
24 O
hr), O
a O
serotonin O
depletor, O
caused O
no O
significant O
change O
in O
the O
hyperactivity. O
The O
study O
suggests O
that O
the O
activity-increasing O
effects O
of O
morphine O
are O
mediated O
by O
the O
release O
of O
catecholamines O
from O
adrenergic O
neurons O
in O
the O
brain. O
And O
the O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
morphine O
acts O
by O
retarding O
the O
release O
of O
acetylcholine O
at O
some O
central O
cholinergic O
synapses. O
It O
is O
also O
suggested O
from O
collected O
evidence O
that O
the O
activity-increasing O
effects O
of O
morphine O
in O
mice O
are O
mediated O

BACKGROUND: O
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons O
(HCFCs) O
are O
used O
increasingly O
in O
industry O
as O
substitutes O
for O
ozone-depleting O
chlorofluorocarbons O
(CFCs). O
Limited O
studies O
in O
animals O
indicate O
potential O
hepatotoxicity B
of O
some O
of O
these O
compounds. O
We O
investigated O
an O
epidemic O
of O
liver B
disease I
in O
nine O
industrial O
workers O
who O
had O
had O
repeated O
accidental O
exposure O
to O
a O
mixture O
of O
1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane O
(HCFC O
123) O
and O
1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane O
(HCFC O
124). O
All O
nine O
exposed O
workers O
were O
affected O
to O
various O
degrees. O
Both O
compounds O
are O
metabolised O
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane O
(halothane) O
to O
form O
reactive O
trifluoroacetyl O
halide O
intermediates, O
which O
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
hepatotoxicity O
of O
halothane. O
We O
aimed O
to O
test O
whether O
HCFCs O
123 O
and O
124 O
can O
result O
in O
serious O
liver O
disease. O
METHODS: O
For O
one O
severely O
affected O
worker O
liver O
biopsy O
and O
immunohistochemical O
stainings O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
trifluoroacetyl O
protein O
adducts O
were O
done. O
The O
serum O
of O
six O
affected O
workers O
and O
five O
controls O
was O
tested O
for O
autoantibodies O
that O
react O
with O
human O
liver O
cytochrome-P450 O
2E1 O
(P450 O
2E1) O
and O
P58 O
protein O
disulphide O
isomerase O
isoform O
(P58). O
FINDINGS: O
The O
liver O
biopsy O
sample O
showed O
hepatocellular O
necrosis B
which O
was O
prominent O
in O
perivenular O
zone O
three O
and O
extended O
focally O
from O
portal O
tracts O
to O
portal O
tracts O
and O
centrilobular O
areas O
(bridging O
necrosis). O
Trifluoroacetyl-adducted O
proteins O
were O
detected O
in O
surviving O
hepatocytes. O
Autoantibodies O
against O
P450 O
2E1 O
or O
P58, O
previously O
associated O
with O
halothane B
hepatitis, I
were O
detected O
in O
the O
serum O
of O
five O
affected O
workers. O
INTERPRETATION: O
Repeated O
exposure O
of O
human O
beings O
to O
HCFCs O
123 O
and O
124 O
can O
result O
in O
serious O
liver B
injury I
in O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
exposed O
population. O
Although O
the O
exact O
mechanism O
of O
hepatotoxicity O
of O
these O
agents O
is O
not O
known, O
the O
results O
suggest O
that O
trifluoroacetyl-altered O
liver O
proteins O
are O
involved. O
In O
view O
of O
the O
potentially O
widespread O
use O
of O
these O
compounds, O
there O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
develop O
safer O
alternatives. O

Intravenous O
administration O
of O
a O
single O
50-mg O
bolus O
of O
lidocaine O
in O
a O
67-year-old O
man O
resulted O
in O
profound O
depression B
of O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
sinoatrial O
and O
atrioventricular O
nodal O
pacemakers. O
The O
patient O
had O
no O
apparent O
associated O
conditions O
which O
might O
have O
predisposed O
him O
to O
the O
development O
of O
bradyarrhythmias; B
and, O
thus, O
this O
probably O
represented O
a O
true O
idiosyncrasy O
to O
lidocaine. O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
influence O
of O
calcium O
channel O
blockers O
on O
bupivacaine-induced O
acute O
toxicity. B
For O
each O
of O
the O
three O
tested O
calcium O
channel O
blockers O
(diltiazem, O
verapamil O
and O
bepridil) O
6 O
groups O
of O
mice O
were O
treated O
by O
two O
different O
doses, O
i.e. O
2 O
and O
10 O
mg/kg/i.p., O
or O
an O
equal O
volume O
of O
saline O
for O
the O
control O
group O
(n O
= O
20); O
15 O
minutes O
later, O
all O
the O
animals O
were O
injected O
with O
a O
single O
50 O
mg/kg/i.p. O
dose O
of O
bupivacaine. O
The O
convulsant O
activity, O
the O
time O
of O
latency O
to O
convulse O
and O
the O
mortality O
rate O
were O
assessed O
in O
each O
group. O
The O
local O
anesthetic-induced O
mortality O
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
the O
three O
different O
calcium O
channel O
blockers. O
The O
convulsant O
activity O
of O
bupivacaine O
was O
not O
significantly O
modified O
but O
calcium O
channel O
blockers O
decreased O
the O
time O
of O
latency O
to O
obtain O
bupivacaine-induced O
convulsions; B
this O
effect O
was O
less O
pronounced O
with O

The O
pathophysiology O
of O
painful B

disorders I
is O
not O
fully O
understood, O
but O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
muscle B
pain I
modulates O
motor O
function O
in O
characteristic O
ways. O
This O
study O
tested O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
activation O
of O
nociceptive B
muscle I
afferent O
fibers O
would O
be O
linked O
to O
an O
increased O
excitability O
of O
the O
human O
jaw-stretch O
reflex O
and O
whether O
this O
process O
would O
be O
sensitive O
to O
length O
and O
velocity O
of O
the O
stretch. O
Capsaicin O
(10 O
micro O
g) O
was O
injected O
into O
the O
masseter O
muscle O
to O
induce O
pain O
in O
11 O
healthy O
volunteers. O
Short-latency O
reflex O
responses O
were O
evoked O
in O
the O
masseter O
and O
temporalis O
muscles O
by O
a O
stretch O
device O
with O
different O
velocities O
and O
displacements O
before, O
during, O
and O
after O
the O
pain. O
The O
normalized O
reflex O
amplitude O
increased O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
velocity O
at O
a O
given O
displacement, O
but O
remained O
constant O
with O
different O
displacements O
at O
a O
given O
velocity. O
The O
normalized O
reflex O
amplitude O
was O
significantly O
higher O
during O
pain, O
but O
only O
at O
faster O
stretches O
in O
the O
painful B
muscle. I
Increased O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
fusimotor O
system O
during O
acute O
muscle O
pain O
could O
be O
one O
likely O
mechanism O
to O
explain O
the O
findings. O

BACKGROUND/AIMS: O
Recently O
ribavirin O
has O
been O
found O
to O
inhibit O
angiogenesis O
and O
a O
number O
of O
angiogenesis O
inhibitors O
such O
as O
sunitinib O
and O
sorafenib O
have O
been O
found O
to O
cause O
acute O
hemolysis. B
We O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
whether O
there O
is O
a O
relation O
between O
hemoglobin, O
haptoglobin O
and O
angiogenesis O
soluble O
markers O
which O
are O
modifiable O
and O
can O
help O
in O
developing O
strategies O
against O
anemia. B
METHODS: O
Fourteen O
patients O
chronically B
infected I
with I
hepatitis B
C I
virus I
were O
treated O
by O
pegylated O
interferon O
alpha O
2a O
and O
ribavirin. O
Serum O
hemoglobin, O
haptoglobin O
and O
angiogenesis O
markers O
of O
vascular O
endothelial O
growth O
factor O
and O
angiopoetin-2 O
were O
investigated O
before O
and O
after O
therapy. O
RESULTS: O
We O
observed O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
haptoglobin O
levels O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
treatment O
period. O
Hemoglobin O
levels O
also O
decreased O
but O
insignificantly O
by O
treatment. O
In O
contrast O
with O
the O
literature, O
serum O
levels O
of O
angiogenesis O
factors O
did O
not O
change O
significantly O
by O
pegylated O
interferon O
and O
ribavirin O
therapy. O
We O
found O
no O
correlation O
of O
angiogenesis O
soluble O
markers O
with O
either O
hemoglobin O
or O
haptoglobin. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
is O
the O
first O
study O
in O
the O
literature O
investigating O
a O
link O
between O
angiogenesis O
soluble O
markers O
and O
ribavirin O
induced O
anemia O
in O
patients O
with O
hepatitis O
C O
and O
we O
could O
not O
find O
any O
relation. O
Future O
research O
with O
larger O
number O
of O
patients O
is O
needed O
to O
find O
out O
modifiable O
factors O
that O
will O
improve O
the O
safety O
of O
ribavirin O
therapy. O

Tolerance O
and O
antiviral O
effect O
of O
ribavirin O
was O
studied O
in O
6 O
patients O
with O
Argentine B
hemorrhagic I
fever I
(AHF) O
of B
more O
than O
8 O
days O
of O
evolution. O
Administration O
of O
ribavirin O
resulted O
in O
a O
neutralization O
of O
viremia B
and O
a O
drop O
of O
endogenous O
interferon O
titers. O
The O
average O
time O
of O
death B
was O
delayed. O
A O
reversible O
anemia B
was O
the O
only O
adverse O
effect O
observed. O
From O
these O
results, O
we O
conclude O
that O
ribavirin O
has O
an O
antiviral O
effect O
in O
advanced O
cases O
of O
AHF, O
and O
that O
anemia, O
the O
only O
secondary O
reaction O
observed, O
can O
be O
easily O
managed. O
The O
possible O
beneficial O
effect O
of O
ribavirin O
during O
the O
initial O
days O
of O
AHF O
is O
discussed. O

In O
the O

both O
the O

increased O
while O
both O
the O
RNA O
content O
and O
ribosomal O
RNA O
biosynthesis O
were O
reduced O
in O
the O
gastrocnemius O

It O
is O
suggested O
that O
the O
drug O
acted O
in O
a O
selective O
and O
tissue-specific O
manner O
to O
enhance O
ribosomal O
RNA O
synthesis O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
depress O
such O
synthesis O
in O
the O
muscle. O
This O
view O
supports O
the O
contention O
that O
the O
liver O
and O

are O
independent O
sites O

PURPOSE: O
To O
evaluate O
the O
frequency, O
severity O
and O
preventability O
of O
warfarin-induced O
cerebral B
haemorrhages I
due O
to O
warfarin O
and O
warfarin-drug O
interactions O
in O
patients O
living O
in O
the O
county O
of O
Osterg O
tland, O
Sweden. O
METHODS: O
All O
patients O
with O
a O
diagnosed O
cerebral O
haemorrhage O
at O
three O
hospitals O
during O
the O
period O
2000-2002 O
were O
identified. O
Medical O
records O
were O
studied O
retrospectively O
to O
evaluate O
whether O
warfarin O
and O
warfarin-drug O
interactions O
could O
have O
caused O
the O
cerebral O
haemorrhage. O
The O
proportion O
of O
possibly O
avoidable O
cases O
due O
to O
drug O
interactions O
was O
estimated. O
RESULTS: O
Among O
593 O
patients O
with O
cerebral O
haemorrhage, O
59 O
(10%) O
were O
assessed O
as O
related O
to O
warfarin O
treatment. O
This O
imply O
an O
incidence O
of O
1.7/100,000 O
treatment O
years. O
Of O
the O
59 O
cases, O
26 O
(44%) O
had O
a O
fatal O
outcome, O
compared O
to O
136 O
(25%) O
among O
the O
non-warfarin O
patients O
(p O
< O
0.01). O
A O
warfarin-drug O
interaction O
could O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
haemorrhage O
in O
24 O
(41%) O
of O
the O
warfarin O
patients O
and O
in O
7 O
of O
these O
(12%) O
the O
bleeding B
complication O
was O
considered O
being O
possible O
to O
avoid. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Warfarin-induced O
cerebral O
haemorrhages O
are O
a O
major O
clinical O
problem O
with O
a O
high O
fatality O
rate. O
Almost O
half O
of O
the O
cases O
was O
related O
to O
a O
warfarin-drug O
interaction. O
A O
significant O
proportion O
of O
warfarin-related O
cerebral O
haemorrhages O
might O
have O
been O
prevented O
if O
greater O
caution O
had O
been O
taken O
when O
prescribing O
drugs O
known O
to O
interact O
with O

Because O
of O
the O
rapid O

of O
BCNU O
(1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea), O

should O
provide O
a O
substantial O
advantage O
over O

6 O
to O
8 O
weeks, O
either O
by O
transfemoral O

or O
IV O
astrocytomas B
were O
treated O
after O
partial O
resection O
of O
the O
tumor B
without O
prior O

therapy. O
After O
two O
to O
seven O
cycles O
of O

nine O
patients O
showed O
a O
decrease O
in O
tumor O
size O
and O

In O
the O
nine O
responders, O
median O
duration O
of O
chemotherapy O
response O
from O
the O
time O
of O
operation O
was O
25 O
weeks O
(range O

therapy O
had O
failed, O
received O
two O
to O
eight O
courses O

OBJECTIVE: O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
effect O
of O
morning-dosed O
modafinil O
on O
sleep O
and O
daytime B
sleepiness I
in O
chronic O
cocaine O
users. O
METHOD: O
Twenty O
cocaine-dependent O
participants O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
receive O
modafinil, O
400 O
mg O
(N=10), O
or O
placebo O
(N=10) O
every O
morning O
at O
7:30 O
a.m. O
for O
16 O
days O
in O
an O
inpatient, O
double-blind O
randomized O
trial. O
Participants O
underwent O
polysomnographic O
sleep O
recordings O
on O
days O
1 O
to O
3, O
7 O
to O
9, O
and O
14 O
to O
16 O
(first, O
second, O
and O
third O
weeks O
of O
abstinence). O
The O
Multiple O
Sleep O
Latency O
Test O
was O
performed O
at O
11:30 O
a.m., O
2:00 O
p.m., O
and O
4:30 O
p.m. O
on O
days O
2, O
8, O
and O
15. O
For O
comparison O
of O
sleep O
architecture O
variables, O
12 O
healthy O
comparison O
participants O
underwent O
a O
single O
night O
of O
experimental O
polysomnography O
that O
followed O
1 O
night O
of O
accommodation O
polysomnography. O
RESULTS: O
Progressive O
abstinence O
from O
cocaine O
was O
associated O
with O
worsening O
of O
all O
measured O
polysomnographic O
sleep O
outcomes. O
Compared O
with O
placebo, O
modafinil O
decreased O
nighttime O
sleep O
latency O
and O
increased O
slow-wave O
sleep O
time O
in O
cocaine-dependent O
participants. O
The O
effect O
of O
modafinil O
interacted O
with O
the O
abstinence O
week O
and O
was O
associated O
with O
longer O
total O
sleep O
time O
and O
shorter O
REM O
sleep O
latency O
in O
the O
third O
week O
of O
abstinence. O
Comparison O
of O
slow-wave O
sleep O
time, O
total O
sleep O
time, O
and O
sleep O
latency O
in O
cocaine-dependent O
and O
healthy O
participants O
revealed O
a O
normalizing O
effect O
of O
modafinil O
in O
cocaine-dependent O
participants. O
Modafinil O
was O
associated O
with O
increased O
daytime O
sleep O
latency, O
as O
measured O
by O
the O
Multiple O
Sleep O
Latency O
Test, O
and O
a O
nearly O
significant O
decrease O
in O
subjective O
daytime O
sleepiness. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Morning-dosed O
modafinil O
promotes O
nocturnal O

and O
decreases O
daytime O

These O

in O
the O

Immunosuppressive O
drugs O
have O
been O
used O
during O
the O
last O
30 O
years O
in O
treatment O
of O
patients O
with O
severe O
rheumatoid B
arthritis. I
The O
drugs O
commonly O
used O
are O
cyclophosphamide O
and O
chlorambucil O
(alkylating O
agents), O
azathioprine O
(purine O
analogue), O
and O
methotrexate O
(folic O
acid O
analogue). O
There O
is O
evidence O
that O
all O
four O
immunosuppressive O
drugs O
can O
reduce O
synovitis, B
but O
disease O
activity O
almost O
always O
recurs O
after O
therapy O
is O
stopped. O
Since O
adverse O
reactions O
are O
frequent, O
less O
than O
50 O
percent O
of O
patients O
are O
able O
to O
continue O
a O
particular O
drug O
for O
more O
than O
one O
year. O
Since O
it O
takes O
three O
to O
12 O
months O
to O
achieve O
maximal O
effects, O
those O
patients O
who O
are O
unable O
to O
continue O
the O
drug O
receive O
little O
benefit O
from O
it. O
Patients O
treated O
with O
alkylating O
agents O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
development O
of O
acute B
nonlymphocytic I
leukemia, I
and O
both O
alkylating O
agents O
and O
azathioprine O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
non-Hodgkin's B
lymphoma. I
Cyclophosphamide O
therapy O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
carcinoma B
of I
the I
bladder. I
There O
have O
been O
several O
long-term O
studies O
of O
patients O
with O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
treated O
with O
azathioprine O
and O
cyclophosphamide O
and O
the O
incidence O
of O
most O
of O
the O
common O
cancers B
is O
not O
increased. O
Data O
on O
the O
possible O
increased O
risk O
of O
malignancy B
in O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
are O
still O
being O
collected, O
and O
until O
further O
information O
is O
available, O
the O
use O
of O
immunosuppressive O
drugs, O
particularly O
alkylating O
agents, O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
should O
be O
reserved O
for O
patients O
with O
severe O
progressive O
disease O
or O
life-threatening O
complications. O

Improved O
outcomes O
among O
patients O
with O
head B
and I
neck I
carcinomas I
require O
investigations O
of O
new O

therapy. O
Preliminary O

and O
the O
paclitaxel/cisplatin O

has O
been O
used O
successfully O
and O
has O
significantly O

We O
initiated O
a O

Of O
20 O
patients O
evaluable O
for O
toxicity, O
four O
had O

disease. O
Treatment, O
given O
every O
21 O
days O
for O
a O
maximum O
of O
three O
cycles, O
consisted O
of O
paclitaxel O
by O
3-hour O

followed O
the O

by O
a O
fixed O

and O
intrapatient O
escalations O
within O
a O

At O
the O

of O
this O
writing, O
dose O
level O
4 O
(260, O
270, O

and O
higher, O
granulocyte O
colony-stimulating O

Of O
18 O
patients O
evaluable O
for O
response, O
seven O
(39%) O
achieved O
a O
complete O

and O
six O
(33%) O
achieved O
a O

Three O
patients O
had O
no O

Results O
thus O

Finally, O
15 O

thus, O
60 O

During O

INTRODUCTION: O
Confusion B
is O
an O
adverse O
drug O
reaction O
frequently O
observed O
with O
valproic O
acid. O
Some O
case O
reports O
are O
published O
in O
the O
literature O
but O
no O
systematic O
study O
from O
a O
sample O
of O
patients O
has O
been O
published. O
We O
performed O
this O
study O
in O
order O
to O
describe O
the O
main O
characteristics O
of O
this O
adverse O
drug O
reaction. O
METHODS: O
Using O
the O
French O
Pharmacovigilance O
database, O
we O
selected O
the O
cases O
of O
confusion B
reported O
since O
1985 O
with O
valproic O
acid. O
RESULTS: O
272 O
cases O
of O
confusion O
were O
reported O
with O
valproic O
acid: O
153 O
women O
and O
119 O
men. O
Confusion O
mostly O
occurred O
during O
the O
two O
first O
weeks O
following O
valproic O
acid O
exposure O
(39.7%). O
It O
was O
"serious" O
for O
almost O
2/3 O
of O
the O
patients O
(62.5%) O
and O
its O
outcome O
favourable O
in O
most O
of O
the O
cases O
(82%). O
The O
occurrence O
of O
this O
ADR O
was O
more O
frequent O
in O
patients O
aged O
between O
61 O
and O
80 O
years. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
work O
shows O
that O
confusion O
with O
valproic O
acid O
is O
a O
serious, O
rather O
frequent O
but O
reversible O
adverse O
drug O
reaction. O
It O
occurs O
especially O
in O
older O
patients O
and O
during O
the O
first O
two O
weeks O
of O
treatment. O

15 O
cases O
of O
cimetidine-associated O
mental O
confusion B
have O
been O
reported. O
In O
order O
that O
this O
syndrome O
might O
be O
investigated O
changes O
in O
mental O
status O
(M.S.) O
were O
correlated O
with O
serum O
concentrations O
and O
renal B
and O
hepatic O
function O
in O
36 O
patients, O
30 O
patients O
had O
no O
M.S. O
change O
on O
cimetidine O
and O
6 O
had O
moderate O
to O
severe O
changes. O
These O
6 O
patients O
had O
both O
renal B
and I
liver B
dysfunction I
(P O
less O
than O
0.05), O
as O
well O
as O
cimetidine O
trough-concentrations O
of O
more O
than O
1.25 O
microgram/ml O
(P O
less O
than O
0.05). O
The O
severity O
of O
M.S. O
changes O
increased O
as O
trough-concentrations O
rose, O
5 O
patients O
had O
lumbar O
puncture. O
The O
cerebrospinal O
fluid: O
serum O
ratio O
of O
cimetidine O
concentrations O
was O
0.24:1 O
and O
indicates O
that O
cimetidine O
passes O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier; O
it O
also O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
M.S. O
changes O
are O
due O
to O
blockade O
of O
histamine O
H2-receptors O
in O
the O
central O
nervous O
system. O
Patients O
likely O
to O
have O
both O
raised O
trough-concentrations O
and O
mental O
confusion O
are O
those O
with O
both O
severe O
renal B
and I
hepatic B
dysfunction. I
They O
should O
be O
closely O
observed O
and O
should O
be O
given O
reduced O
doses O
of O
cimetidine. O

In O
a O
patient O
with O
WPW B

was O
observed O
in O
a O
29-year-old O
female O
in O
the O
prognostic O
period O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
carmofur-induced O
leukoencephalopathy. B
Symptoms O
such O
as O
euphoria, O
emotional O
lability O
and O
puerile O
attitude O
noted O
in O
the O
patient O
were O
diagnosed O
as O
organic B
personality I
syndrome I
according O
to O
the O
criteria O
defined O
in O
the O
DSM-III-R. O
It O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
frontal B
lobe I
syndrome. I
Brain O
CT O
revealed O
a O
periventricular O
low O
density O
area O
in O
the O
frontal O
white O
matter O
and O
moderate O
dilatation O
of O
the O
lateral O
ventricles O
especially O
at O
the O
bilateral O
anterior O
horns. O
Consequently, O
carmofur-induced O
leukoencephalopathy O
may O
uncommonly O
result O
in O
organic O
personality O
syndrome O
in O
the O
residual O
state. O
It O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
structural B
damage I
to I
the I
frontal I
lobe. I

In O
cyclophosphamide-induced O
cystitis B
in O
the O
rat, O
detrusor O
function O
is O
impaired O
and O
the O

effects O
of O
muscarinic O
receptors O
altered. O
Whether O
or O
not O
the O
neuronal O
transmission O
may O
be O
affected O
by O
cystitis O
was O
presently O
investigated. O
Responses O
of O
urinary O
strip O
preparations O
from O
control O
and O
cyclophosphamide-pretreated O
rats O
to O
electrical O
field O
stimulation O
and O
to O
agonists O
were O
assessed O
in O
the O
absence O
and O
presence O
of O
muscarinic, O
adrenergic O
and O
purinergic O
receptor O
antagonists. O
Generally, O
atropine O
reduced O
contractions, O
but O
in O
contrast O
to O
controls, O
it O
also O
reduced O
responses O
to O
low O
electrical O
field O
stimulation O
intensity O
(1-5 O
Hz) O
in O
inflamed O
preparations. O
In O
both O
types, O
purinoceptor O
desensitization O
with O
alpha,beta-methylene O
adenosine-5'-triphosphate O
(alpha,beta-meATP) O
caused O
further O
reductions O
at O
low O
frequencies O
(<10 O
Hz). O
The O
muscarinic O
receptor O
antagonists O
atropine, O
4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine O
(4-DAMP) O
('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), O
methoctramine O
('M(2)-selective') O
and O
pirenzepine O
('M(1)-selective') O
antagonized O
the O
tonic O
component O
of O
the O
electrical O
field O
stimulation-evoked O
contractile O
response O
more O
potently O
than O
the O
phasic O
component. O
4-DAMP O
inhibited O
the O
tonic O
contractions O
in O
controls O
more O
potently O
than O
methoctramine O
and O
pirenzepine. O
In O
inflamed O
preparations, O
the O
muscarinic O
receptor O
antagonism O
on O
the O
phasic O
component O
of O
the O
electrical O
field O
stimulation-evoked O
contraction O
was O
decreased O
and O
the O
pirenzepine O
and O
4-DAMP O
antagonism O
on O
the O
tonic O
component O
was O
much O
less O
efficient O
than O
in O
controls. O
In O
contrast O
to O
controls, O
methoctramine O
increased O
-- O
instead O
of O
decreased O
-- O
the O
tonic O
responses O
at O
high O
frequencies. O
While O
contractions O
to O
carbachol O
and O
ATP O
were O
the O
same O
in O
inflamed O
and O
in O
control O
strips O
when O
related O
to O
a O
reference O
potassium O
response, O
isoprenaline-induced O
relaxations O
were O
smaller O
in O
inflamed O
strips. O
Thus, O
in O
cystitis O
substantial O
changes O
of O
the O
efferent O
functional O
responses O
occur. O
While O
postjunctional O
beta-adrenoceptor-mediated O
relaxations O
are O
reduced, O
effects O
by O
prejunctional O
inhibitory O
muscarinic O
receptors O
may O
be O
increased. O

impaired. O
Although O
most O
cases O
of O
antibiotic O

are O
benign O

some O

A O
combination O
of O

of O
nelarabine O
(AraG) O
with O
5 O
d O
of O
etoposide O

and O
cyclophosphamide O
(CPM) O
and O

was O
used O
as O
salvage O
therapy O
in O
seven O
children O
with O
refractory O

T-cell B
leukaemia I
or I
lymphoma. I
The O
most O
common O
side O
effects O
attributable O
to O
the O
AraG O
included O
Grade O
2 O
and O
3 O
sensory O
and O

pain. I
Haematological B
toxicity I
was O
greater O
for O
the O
combination O
than O
AraG O
alone, O
although O
median O
time O

was O
consistent O
with O
other O

therapies. O
All O
patients O
had O
some O

five O
of O
the O
seven O
went O
into O

the O
safety O
of O

BACKGROUND: O
Cocaine O
is O
a O
widely O
abused O
psychostimulant O
that O
has O
both O
rewarding O
and O
aversive O
properties. O
While O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
cocaine's O
rewarding O
effects O
have O
been O
studied O
extensively, O
less O
attention O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
the O
unpleasant O
behavioral O
states O
induced O
by O
cocaine, O
such O
as O
anxiety. B
METHODS: O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
performance O
of O
dopamine O
beta-hydroxylase O
knockout O
(Dbh O
-/-) O
mice, O
which O
lack O
norepinephrine O
(NE), O
in O
the O
elevated O
plus O
maze O
(EPM) O
to O
examine O
the O
contribution O
of O
noradrenergic O
signaling O
to O
cocaine-induced O
anxiety. O
RESULTS: O
We O
found O
that O
cocaine O
dose-dependently O
increased O
anxiety-like O
behavior O
in O
control O
(Dbh O
+/-) O
mice, O
as O
measured O
by O
a O
decrease O
in O
open O
arm O
exploration. O
The O
Dbh O
-/- O
mice O
had O
normal O
baseline O
performance O
in O
the O
EPM O
but O
were O
completely O
resistant O
to O
the O
anxiogenic O
effects O
of O
cocaine. O
Cocaine-induced O
anxiety O
was O
also O
attenuated O
in O
Dbh O
+/- O
mice O
following O
administration O
of O
disulfiram, O
a O
dopamine O
beta-hydroxylase O
(DBH) O
inhibitor. O
In O
experiments O
using O
specific O
adrenergic O
antagonists, O
we O
found O
that O
pretreatment O
with O
the O
beta-adrenergic O
receptor O
antagonist O
propranolol O
blocked O
cocaine-induced O
anxiety-like O
behavior O
in O
Dbh O
+/- O
and O
wild-type O
C57BL6/J O
mice, O
while O
the O
alpha(1) O
antagonist O
prazosin O
and O
the O
alpha(2) O
antagonist O
yohimbine O
had O
no O
effect. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
noradrenergic O
signaling O
via O
beta-adrenergic O
receptors O
is O
required O
for O
cocaine-induced O
anxiety O
in O
mice. O

Pain B
not O
responsive O
to O
morphine O
is O
often O
problematic. O
Animal O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
N-methyl-D-aspartate O
(NMDA) O
antagonists, O
such O
as O
ketamine, O
may O
be O
effective O
in O
improving O
opioid O
analgesia O
in O
difficult O
pain B
syndromes, O
such O
as O
neuropathic B
pain. I
A O
slow O
bolus O
of O
subhypnotic O
doses O
of O
ketamine O
(0.25 O
mg/kg O
or O
0.50 O
mg/kg) O
was O
given O
to O
10 O
cancer B
patients O
whose O
pain O
was O
unrelieved O
by O
morphine O
in O
a O
randomized, O
double-blind, O
crossover, O
double-dose O
study. O
Pain O
intensity O
on O
a O
0 O
to O
10 O
numerical O
scale; O
nausea B
and O
vomiting, B
drowsiness, O
confusion, B
and O
dry B
mouth, I
using O
a O
scale O
from O
0 O
to O
3 O
(not O
at O
all, O
slight, O
a O
lot, O
awful); O
Mini-Mental O
State O
Examination O
(MMSE) O
(0-30); O
and O
arterial O
pressure O
were O
recorded O
before O
administration O
of O
drugs O
(T0) O
and O
after O
30 O
minutes O
(T30), O
60 O
minutes O
(T60), O
120 O
minutes O
(T120), O
and O
180 O
minutes O
(T180). O
Ketamine, O
but O
not O
saline O
solution, O
significantly O
reduced O
the O
pain O
intensity O
in O
almost O
all O
the O
patients O
at O
both O
doses. O
This O
effect O
was O
more O
relevant O
in O
patients O
treated O
with O
higher O
doses. O
Hallucinations B
occurred O
in O
4 O
patients, O
and O
an O
unpleasant O
sensation O
("empty O
head") O
was O
also O
reported O
by O
2 O
patients. O
These O
episodes O
reversed O
after O
the O
administration O
of O
diazepam O
1 O
mg O
intravenously. O
Significant O
increases O
in O
drowsiness O
were O
reported O
in O
patients O
treated O
with O
ketamine O
in O
both O
groups O
and O
were O
more O
marked O
with O
ketamine O
0.50 O
mg/kg. O
A O
significant O
difference O
in O
MMSE O
was O
observed O
at O
T30 O
in O
patients O
who O
received O
0.50 O
mg/kg O
of O
ketamine. O
Ketamine O
can O
improve O
morphine O
analgesia O
in O
difficult O
pain O
syndromes, O
such O
as O
neuropathic O
pain. O
However, O
the O
occurrence O
of O
central O
adverse O
effects O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account, O
especially O
when O
using O
higher O
doses. O
This O
observation O
should O
be O
tested O
in O
studies O
of O
prolonged O
ketamine O
administration. O

Depression B
and O
sexual B
dysfunction I
have O
been O
related O
to O
side O
effects O
of O
topical O
beta-blockers. O
We O
performed O
a O
preliminary O
study O
in O
order O
to O
determine O
any O
difference O
between O
a O
non O
selective O
beta-blocker O
(timolol) O
and O
a O
selective O
beta-blocker O
(betaxolol) O
regarding O
CNS O
side O
effects. O
Eight O
glaucomatous B
patients O
chronically O
treated O
with O
timolol O
0.5%/12h, O
suffering O
from O
depression B
diagnosed O
through O
DMS-III-R O
criteria, O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study. O
During O
the O
six-month O
follow O
up, O
depression O
was O
quantified O
through O
the O
Beck O
and O
Zung-Conde O
scales O
every O
two O
months. O
In O
a O
double O
blind O
cross-over O
study O
with O
control O
group, O
the O
patients O
under O
timolol O
treatment O
presented O
higher O
depression O
values O
measured O
through O
the O
Beck O
and O
the O
Zung-Conde O
scales O
(p O
< O
0.001 O
vs O
control). O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
betaxolol O
could O
be O
less O
of O
a O
depression-inducer O
than O
timolol O
in O
predisposed O
patients. O

An O
experiment O
was O
performed O
to O
test O
whether O
inclusion O
of O
phenobarbital O
in O
a O

Groups O
of O
5-week O
old O

Fischer-344 O
rats O
were O
fed O
for O
7-25 O
months O
semipurified O
choline-devoid O
or O
choline-supplemented O
diets, O
containing O
or O
not O
0.06% O

diet, O
while O
one O
preneoplastic O
nodule O
and O
one O
hepatocellular O
carcinoma O
developed O
in O
two O
rats O
fed O
the O
same O
diet O
containing O
phenobarbital. O
The O
incidence O
of O
preneoplastic O
nodules O
and O
of O
hepatocellular O
carcinomas O
was O
10% O
and O
37%, O
respectively, O
in O
rats O
fed O
the O
plain O
choline-devoid O
diet, O
and O
17% O
and O
30%, O
in O

The O
results O
evinced O
no O
enhancement O
of O
the O
hepatocarcinogenicity O
of O
the O
choline-devoid O
diet O
by O
phenobarbital. O
Sporadic O

We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
intractable O

Conservative O
treatment, O
including O
bladder O
irrigation O
with O
physiological O
saline O
and O
instillation O
of O
prostaglandin O
F2 O
alpha, O
failed O
to O
totally O

We O
then O
used O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
at O
an O
absolute O
pressure O
of O
2 O
atm, O
5 O
days O
a O

for O
8 O
consecutive O
weeks. O
The O
bleeding B
ceased O
completely O
by O
the O
end O
of O
treatment O
and O
the O
patient O
remained O
free O
of O
hematuria B
thereafter. O
No O
side O
effect O
was O
noted O
during O
the O
course O
of O
therapy. O
In O
future, O
this O
form O
of O

can O
offer O
a O
safe O
alternative O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O

Fluoxetine-induced O
akathisia: B
clinical O
and O
theoretical O
implications. O

-Tacrolimus O
(FK O
506) O
is O
a O
powerful, O
widely O
used O
immunosuppressant. O
The O
clinical O
utility O
of O
FK O
506 O
is O
complicated O
by O
substantial O
hypertension B
and O
nephrotoxicity. B
To O
clarify O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
FK O
506-induced O
hypertension, O
we O
studied O
the O
chronic O
effects O
of O
FK O
506 O
on O
the O
synthesis O
of O
endothelin-1 O
(ET-1), O
the O
expression O
of O
mRNA O
of O
ET-1 O
and O
endothelin-converting O
enzyme-1 O
(ECE-1), O
the O
endothelial O
nitric O
oxide O
synthase O
(eNOS) O
activity, O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
mRNA O
of O
eNOS O
and O
C-type O
natriuretic O
peptide O
(CNP) O
in O
rat O
blood O
vessels. O
In O
addition, O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
specific O
endothelin O
type O
A O
receptor O
antagonist O
FR O
139317 O
on O
FK O
506-induced O
hypertension O
in O
rats O
was O
studied. O
FK O
506, O
5 O
mg. O
kg-1. O
d-1 O
given O
for O
4 O
weeks, O
elevated O
blood O
pressure O
from O
102+/-13 O
to O
152+/-15 O
mm O
Hg O
and O
increased O
the O
synthesis O
of O
ET-1 O
and O
the O
levels O
of O
ET-1 O
mRNA O
in O
the O
mesenteric O
artery O
(240% O
and O
230%, O
respectively). O
Little O
change O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
ECE-1 O
mRNA O
and O
CNP O
mRNA. O
FK O
506 O
decreased O
eNOS O
activity O
and O
the O
levels O
of O
eNOS O
mRNA O
in O
the O
aorta O
(48% O
and O
55%, O
respectively). O
The O
administration O
of O
FR O
139317 O
(10 O
mg. O
kg-1. O
d-1) O
prevented O
FK O
506-induced O
hypertension O
in O
rats. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
FK O
506 O
may O
increase O
blood O
pressure O
not O
only O
by O
increasing O
ET-1 O
production O
but O
also O
by O
decreasing O
NO O
synthesis O
in O
the O
vasculature. O

The O
antiepileptic O
drugs, O
phenobarbitone O
and O
carbamazepine O
are O
well O
known O
to O
cause O
cognitive B
impairment I
on O
chronic O
use. O
The O
increase O
in O
free O
radical O
generation O
has O
been O
implicated O
as O
one O
of O
the O
important O
mechanisms O
of O
cognitive O
impairment O
by O
antiepileptic O
drugs. O
Curcumin O
has O
shown O
antioxidant, O
anti-inflammatory O
and O
neuro-protective O
properties. O
Therefore, O
the O
present O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
chronic O
curcumin O
administration O
on O
phenobarbitone- O
and O
carbamazepine-induced O
cognitive O
impairment O
and O
oxidative O
stress O
in O
rats. O
Pharmacokinetic O
interactions O
of O
curcumin O
with O
phenobarbitone O
and O
carbamazepine O
were O
also O
studied. O
Vehicle/drugs O
were O
administered O
daily O
for O
21days O
to O
male O
Wistar O
rats. O
Passive O
avoidance O
paradigm O
and O
elevated O
plus O
maze O
test O
were O
used O
to O
assess O
cognitive O
function. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
study O
period, O
serum O
phenobarbitone O
and O
carbamazepine, O
whole O
brain O
malondialdehyde O
and O
reduced O
glutathione O
levels O
were O
estimated. O
The O
administration O
of O
phenobarbitone O
and O
carbamazepine O
for O
21days O
caused O
a O
significant O
impairment B
of I
learning I
and I
memory I
as O
well O
as O
an O
increased O
oxidative O
stress. O
Concomitant O
curcumin O
administration O
prevented O
the O
cognitive O
impairment O
and O
decreased O
the O
increased O
oxidative O
stress O
induced O
by O
these O
antiepileptic O
drugs. O
Curcumin O
co-administration O
did O
not O
cause O
any O
significant O
alteration O
in O
the O
serum O
concentrations O
of O
both O
phenobarbitone O
as O
well O
as O
carbamazepine. O
These O
results O
show O
that O
curcumin O
has O
beneficial O
effect O
in O
mitigating O
the O
deterioration B
of I
cognitive I
functions I
and O
oxidative O
damage O
in O
rats O
treated O
with O
phenobarbitone O
and O
carbamazepine O
without O
significantly O
altering O
their O
serum O
concentrations. O
The O
findings O
suggest O
that O
curcumin O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
potential O
safe O
and O
effective O
adjuvant O
to O
phenobarbitone O
and O
carbamazepine O
therapy O
in O
preventing O
cognitive O
impairment O
associated O

BACKGROUND: O
Current O
animal O
models O
of O
obsessive-compulsive B
disorder I
(OCD) O
typically B
involve O
acute, O
drug-induced O
symptom O
provocation O
or O
a O
genetic O
association O
with O
stereotypies O
or O
anxiety. B
None O
of O
these O
current O
models O
demonstrate O
multiple O
OCD-like O
behaviors. O
METHODS: O
Neonatal O
rats O
were O
treated O
with O
the O
tricyclic O
antidepressant O
clomipramine O
or O
vehicle O
between O
days O
9 O
and O
16 O
twice O
daily O
and O
behaviorally O
tested O
in O
adulthood. O
RESULTS: O
Clomipramine O
exposure O
in O
immature O
rats O
produced O
significant O
behavioral O
and O
biochemical O
changes O
that O
include O
enhanced O
anxiety O
(elevated O
plus O
maze O
and O
marble O
burying), O
behavioral B
inflexibility I
(perseveration O
in O
the O
spontaneous O
alternation O
task O
and O
impaired O
reversal O
learning), O
working O
memory B
impairment I
(e.g., O
win-shift O
paradigm), O
hoarding, B
and O
corticostriatal B
dysfunction. I
Dopamine O
D2 O
receptors O
were O
elevated O
in O
the O
striatum, O
whereas O
serotonin O
2C, O
but O
not O
serotonin O
1A, O
receptors O
were O
elevated O
in O
the O
orbital O
frontal O
cortex. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
is O
the O
first O
demonstration O
of O
multiple O
symptoms O
consistent O
with O
an O
OCD-like O
profile O
in O
animals. O
Moreover, O
these O
behaviors O
are O
accompanied O
by O
biochemical O
changes O
in O
brain O
regions O
previously O
identified O
as O
relevant O
to O
OCD. O
This O
novel O
model O
of O
OCD O
demonstrates O
that O
drug O
exposure O
during O
a O
sensitive O
period O
can O
program O
disease-like O
systems O
permanently, O
which O
could O
have O
implications O
for O
current O
and O
future O
therapeutic O
strategies O
for O
this O
and O
other O
psychiatric B

The O

with O
some O
of O
the O
cardiovascular O
consequences O
of O
cocaine O
use. O
In O
particular, O
the O
tendency O
of O
cocaine O
to O
produce O
chest B

ought O
to O
be O
in O
the O

The O
mechanism O
of O
chest O

are O
discussed. O
Finally, O

PATIENT(S): O
A O
36-year-old O

MAIN O
OUTCOME O
MEASURE(S): O
Central O

RESULT(S): O
A O
36-year-old O
Chinese O

after O
eight O
courses O
of O
CC. O
A O
search O
of O

not O
include O
this O
severe O

not O
uncommon. O
CONCLUSION(S): O
This O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
central O
retinal O

occlusion O
after O
treatment O
with O
CC. O
Extra O
caution O
is O
warranted O
in O
treating O
infertility O

ability O
developed O
during O
continuous O
long-term O

were O
examined O
after O
a O
recovery O
period O
of O
up O
to O
18 O
weeks, O
when O
no O
analgesics O
were O
given, O
to O
investigate O
whether O
the O
analgesic-induced O
changes O
were O
reversible. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
repair O
to O
the O

matrix, O
or O
proliferation O
of O
remaining O
undamaged O
type O
1 O
medullary O
interstitial O
cells O
after O
the O
recovery O
period O
following O
analgesic O
treatment. O
The O
recovery O
of O
urinary O
concentrating O
ability O
was O
related O
to O
the O
length O
of O
analgesic O
treatment O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
resulting O
inner O
medullary O
structural O
damage. O
During O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
analgesic O
treatment, O
the O
changes O
in O
urinary O
concentrating O
ability O
were O
reversible, O
but O
after O
prolonged O
analgesic O
treatment, O
maximum O
urinary O
concentrating O
ability O
failed O
to O
recover. O
This O
study O
shows O
that O
prolonged O
analgesic O
treatment O
in O
Fischer O
344 O
rats O
causes O
progressive O
and O
irreversible O
damage O
to O
the O
interstitial O
matrix O
and O
type O
1 O
interstitial O
cells O
leading O
to O
RPN. O
The O
associated O
urinary O
concentrating O
defect O
is O
reversible O
only O
during O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
structural O
damage O
to O
the O
inner O

PATIENTS O
AND O
METHODS: O
Forty-six O
eligible O
patients O
with O
measurable O
lesions O
were O
included O
and O
were O
stratified O
according O
to O
previous O
chemotherapy. O
Thirty O
patients O
without O
prior O
chemotherapy O
and O
16 O
pretreated O
with O
cisplatin-based O
chemotherapy O
were O
assessable O
for O
toxicity B
and O
response. O
VNB O
was O
administered O
weekly O
as O
a O
25-mg/m2 O
short O
intravenous O
(i.v.) O
infusion. O
RESULTS: O
Six O
of O
30 O
patients O
(20%) O
without O
prior O
chemotherapy O
achieved O
a O
partial O
response O
(PR) O
(95% O
confidence O
interval O
[CI], O
8% O
to O
39%). O
The O
median O
duration O
of O
response O
was O
21 O
weeks O
(range, O
17 O
to O
28). O
One O
of O
16 O
patients O
(6%) O
with O
prior O
chemotherapy O
had O
a O
complete O
response O
(CR) O
of O
31 O
weeks' O
duration O
(95% O
CI, O
0% O
to O
30%). O
The O
overall O
response O
rate O
(World O
Health O
Organization O
[WHO] O
criteria) O
was O
15% O
(CR, O
2%; O
PR O
13%; O
95% O
CI, O
6% O
to O
29%). O
The O
median O
dose-intensity O
(DI) O
was O
20 O
mg/m2/wk. O
VNB O
was O
well O
tolerated O
and O
zero O
instances O
of O
WHO O
grade O
4 O
nonhematologic O
toxicity O
occurred. O
At O
least O
one O
episode O
of O
grade O
3 O
or O
4 O
granulocytopenia B
was O
seen O
in O
59% O
of O
patients. O
A O
grade O
2 O
or O
3 O
infection B
occurred O
in O
16% O
of O
patients, O
but O
no O
toxic O
deaths B
occurred. O
Other O
side O
effects O
were O
rare, O
and O
peripheral B
neurotoxicity I
has O
been O
minor O
(26% O
grade O
1). O
CONCLUSION: O
These O
data O
indicate O
that O
VNB O
is O
an O
active O
agent O
in O
metastatic O
esophageal B
squamous I
cell I
carcinoma. I
Given O
its O
excellent O
tolerance O
profile O
and O
low O
toxicity, O
further O
evaluation O
of O
VNB O
in O
combination O
therapy O
is O
warranted. O

was O
41.4 O
+/- O
6.5 O
mg. O

(6 O
mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), O

+/- O
10.9 O
mg. O
l(-1) O
when O
the O

0.8%. O
However, O
the O
threshold O
(61.6 O
+/- O
8.7 O
mg. O
l(-1)) O
during O
1.6% O
sevoflurane O
was O
not O
significant O
from O
that O
during O

effect. O
There O
was O
no O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
convulsive O
threshold O
between O
sevoflurane O
and O

The O
rise O
in O

PURPOSE: O
The O
multidrug O
resistance O
protein O
2 O
(MRP2) O
is O
a O
drug O
efflux O
transporter O
that O
is O
expressed O
predominantly O
at O
the O
apical O
domain O
of O
hepatocytes O
but O
seems O
also O
to O
be O
expressed O
at O
the O
apical O
membrane O
of O
brain O
capillary O
endothelial O
cells O
that O
form O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB). O
MRP2 O
is O
absent O
in O
the O
transport-deficient O
(TR(-)) O
Wistar O
rat O
mutant, O
so O
that O
this O
rat O
strain O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
defining O
substrates O
of O
MRP2 O
by O
comparing O
tissue O
concentrations O
or O
functional O
activities O
of O
compounds O
in O
MRP2-deficient O
rats O
with O
those O
in O
transport-competent O
Wistar O
rats. O
By O
using O
this O
strategy O
to O
study O
the O
involvement O
of O
MRP2 O
in O
brain O
access O
of O
antiepileptic O
drugs O
(AEDs), O
we O
recently O
reported O
that O
phenytoin O
is O
a O
substrate O
for O
MRP2 O
in O
the O
BBB. O
However, O
one O
drawback O
of O
such O
studies O
in O
genetically O
deficient O
rats O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
compensatory O
changes O
with O
upregulation O
of O
other O
transporters O
can O
occur. O
This O
prompted O
us O
to O
study O
the O
brain O
expression O
of O
P-glycoprotein O
(Pgp), O
a O
major O
drug O
efflux O
transporter O
in O
many O
tissues, O
including O
the O
BBB, O
in O
TR(-) O
rats O
compared O
with O
nonmutant O
(wild-type) O
Wistar O
rats. O
METHODS: O
The O
expression O
of O
MRP2 O
and O
Pgp O
in O
brain O
and O
liver O
sections O
of O
TR(-) O
rats O
and O
normal O
Wistar O
rats O
was O
determined O
with O
immunohistochemistry, O
by O
using O
a O
novel, O
highly O
selective O
monoclonal O
MRP2 O
antibody O
and O
the O
monoclonal O
Pgp O
antibody O
C219, O
respectively. O
RESULTS: O
Immunofluorescence O
staining O
with O
the O
MRP2 O
antibody O
was O
found O
to O
label O
a O
high O
number O
of O
microvessels O
throughout O
the O
brain O
in O
normal O
Wistar O
rats, O
whereas O
such O
labeling O
was O
absent O
in O
TR(-) O
rats. O
TR(-) O
rats O
exhibited O
a O
significant O
up-regulation O
of O
Pgp O
in O
brain O
capillary O
endothelial O
cells O
compared O
with O
wild-type O
controls. O
No O
such O
obvious O
upregulation O
of O
Pgp O
was O
observed O
in O
liver O
sections. O
A O
comparable O
overexpression O
of O
Pgp O
in O
the O
BBB O
was O
obtained O
after O
pilocarpine-induced O
seizures B
in O
wild-type O
Wistar O
rats. O
Experiments O
with O
systemic O
administration O
of O
the O
Pgp O
substrate O
phenobarbital O
and O
the O
selective O
Pgp O
inhibitor O
tariquidar O
in O
TR(-) O
rats O
substantiated O
that O
Pgp O
is O
functional O
and O
compensates O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
MRP2 O
in O
the O
BBB. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
data O
on O
TR(-) O
rats O
indicate O
that O
Pgp O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
compensation O
of O
MRP2 O
deficiency O
in O
the O
BBB. O
Because O
such O
a O
compensatory O
mechanism O
most O
likely O
occurs O
to O
reduce O
injury B
to I
the I
brain I
from O
cytotoxic O
compounds, O
the O
present O
data O
substantiate O
the O
concept O
that O
MRP2 O
performs O
a O
protective O
role O
in O
the O
BBB. O
Furthermore, O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
TR(-) O
rats O
are O
an O
interesting O
tool O
to O
study O
consequences O
of O
overexpression O
of O
Pgp O
in O
the O
BBB O
on O
access O
of O
drugs O
in O
the O
brain, O
without O
the O
need O
of O
inducing O

or O
other O

BACKGROUND: O
Electrocardiography O
has O
a O
very O
low O
sensitivity O
in O
detecting O
dobutamine-induced O
myocardial B
ischemia. I
OBJECTIVES: O
To O
assess O
the O

of O
a O
new O
cardiac O

index O
(dP/dtejc) O
measurement, O
based O
on O
brachial O
artery O
flow O
changes, O
as O
compared O
to O
standard O
12-lead O
ECG, O
for O
detecting O
dobutamine-induced O
myocardial O
ischemia, O
using O
Tc99m-Sestamibi O
single-photon O
emission O
computed O
tomography O
as O
the O
gold O
standard O
of O
comparison O
to O
assess O
the O
presence O
or O

of O
ischemia. O
METHODS: O
The O
study O
group O
comprised O
40 O
patients O
undergoing O
Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine O
stress O
test. O
Simultaneous O
measurements O
of O
ECG O
and O
brachial O
artery O
dP/dtejc O
were O
performed O
at O
each O
dobutamine O
level. O
In O
19 O
of O
the O
40 O
patients O
perfusion O
defects O
compatible O
with O
ischemia O
were O
detected O
on O
SPECT. O
The O
increase O
in O
dP/dtejc O
during O
infusion O
of O
dobutamine O
in O
this O
group O
was O
severely O
impaired O
as O
compared O
to O
the O
non-ischemic O
group. O
dP/dtejc O
outcome O
was O
combined O
with O
the O
ECG O
results, O
giving O
an O
ECG-enhanced O
value, O
and O
compared O
to O
ECG O
alone. O
RESULTS: O
The O
sensitivity O
improved O
dramatically O
from O
16% O
to O
79%, O
positive O
predictive O
value O
increased O
from O
60% O
to O
68% O
and O
negative O
predictive O
value O
from O
54% O

78%, O
and O
specificity O
decreased O
from O
90% O
to O
67%. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
If O
ECG O
alone O
is O
used O
for O
specificity, O
the O
combination O
with O
dP/dtejc O
improved O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
test O
and O
could O
be O
a O
cost-savings O
alternative O
to O

These O

however, O
s-perillyl O

relieved O
the O

Analysis O
of O
neurotransmitter O
concentration O
in O
some O
brain O
regions O
on O
the O
test O
day O
showed O
that O
dopamine O
concentration O

group O
was O
significantly O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
the O

but O
this O
phenomenon O
was O
reversed O
when O
s-limonene O
or O
s-perillyl O
alcohol O
were O
administered O
before O
the O
injection O
of O
scopolamine. O
Simultaneously, O
we O
found O
that O
these O

Based O
on O
clinical O
data, O
indicating O
that O
chloroacetaldehyde O
(CAA) O
is O
an O
important O
metabolite O
of O
oxazaphosphorine O
cytostatics, O
an O
experimental O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
in O
order O
to O
elucidate O
the O
role O
of O
CAA O
in O
the O
development O
of O
hemorrhagic B
cystitis. B
The O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
CAA O
after O
i.v. O
administration O
does O
not O
contribute O
to O
bladder B
damage. I
When O
instilled O
directly O
into O
the O
bladder, O
CAA O
exerts O
urotoxic O
effects, O
it O
is, O
however, O
susceptible O
to O
detoxification O
with O
mesna. O

BACKGROUND: O
Fibrin O
sealants O
(FS) O
derived O
from O
human O
plasma O
are O
frequently O
used O
in O
neurosurgery. O
In O
order O
to O
increase O
clot O
stability, O
FS O
typically O
contain O
aprotinin, O
a O
natural O
fibrinolysis O
inhibitor. O
Recently, O
synthetic O
fibrinolysis O
inhibitors O
such O
as O
tranexamic O
acid O
(tAMCA) O
have O
been O
considered O
as O
substitutes O
for O
aprotinin. O
However, O
tAMCA O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
cause O
epileptic B
seizures. B
We O
wanted O
to O
study O
whether O
tAMCA O
retains O
its O
convulsive B
action O
if O
incorporated O
into O
a O
FS. O
METHOD: O
FS O
containing O
aprotinin O
or O
different O
concentrations O
of O
tAMCA O
(0.5-47.5 O
mg/ml) O
were O
applied O
to O
the O
pial O
surface O
of O
the O
cortex O
of O
anaesthetized O
rats. O
The O
response O
of O
the O
animals O
was O
evaluated O
using O
electroencephalography O
and O
by O
monitoring O
the O
clinical O
behaviour O
during O
and O
after O
recovery O
from O
anaesthesia. O
FINDINGS: O
FS O
containing O
tAMCA O
caused O
paroxysmal O
brain O
activity O
which O
was O
associated O
with O
distinct O
convulsive O
behaviours. O
The O
degree O
of O
these O
seizures O
increased O
with O
increasing O
concentration O
of O
tAMCA. O
Thus, O
FS O
containing O
47.5 O
mg/ml O
tAMCA O
evoked O
generalized B
seizures I
in O
all O
tested O
rats O
(n=6) O
while O
the O
lowest O
concentration O
of O
tAMCA O
(0.5 O
mg/ml) O
only O
evoked O
brief O
episodes O
of O
jerk-correlated O
convulsive O
potentials O
in O
1 O
of O
6 O
rats. O
In O
contrast, O
FS O
containing O
aprotinin O
did O
not O
evoke O
any O
paroxysmal O
activity. O
INTERPRETATION: O
Tranexamic O
acid O
retains O
its O
convulsive O
action O
within O
FS. O
Thus, O
use O
of O
FS O
containing O
tAMCA O
for O
surgery O
within O
or O
close O
to O
the O
CNS O
may O
pose O
a O
substantial O
risk O
to O
the O
patient. O

propylthiouracil. O
This O
is O
an O
addition O
to O
the O
list O
of O
drugs O
that O
must O
be O
considered O
in O
the O
evaluation O
of O
chronic O
liver B
disease. I

Coniine, O
an O
alkaloid O
from O
Conium O
maculatum O
(poison O
hemlock), O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
teratogenic O
in O
livestock. O
The O
major O
teratogenic O
outcome O
is O
arthrogryposis, B
presumably O
due O
to O
nicotinic O
receptor O
blockade. O
However, O
coniine O
has O
failed O
to O
produce O
arthrogryposis O
in O
rats O
or O
mice O
and O
is O
only O
weakly O
teratogenic O
in O
rabbits. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
and O
compare O
the O
effects O
of O
coniine O
and O
nicotine O
in O
the O
developing O
chick. O
Concentrations O
of O
coniine O
and O
nicotine O
sulfate O
were O
0.015%, O
0.03%, O
0.075%, O
0.15%, O
0.75%, O
1.5%, O
3%, O
and O
6% O
and O
1%, O
5%, O
and O
10%, O
respectively. O
Both O
compounds O
caused O
deformations B
and O
lethality O
in O
a O
dose-dependent O
manner. O
All O
concentrations O
of O
nicotine O
sulfate O
caused O
some O
lethality O
but O
a O
no O
effect O
level O
for O
coniine O
lethality O
was O
0.75%. O
The O
deformations O
caused O
by O
both O
coniine O
and O
nicotine O
sulfate O
were O
excessive B
flexion I
or I
extension I
of I
one I
or I
more I
toes. I
No O
histopathological O
alterations O
or O
differences O
in O
bone O
formation O
were O
seen O
in O
the O
limbs O
or O
toes O
of O
any O
chicks O
from O
any O
group; O
however, O
extensive O
cranial B
hemorrhage I
occurred O
in O
all O
nicotine O
sulfate-treated O
chicks. O
There O
was O
a O
statistically O
significant O
(P O
< O
or O
= O
0.01) O
decrease O
in O
movement O
in O
coniine O
and O
nicotine O
sulfate O
treated O
chicks O
as O
determined O
by O
ultrasound. O
Control O
chicks O
were O
in O
motion O
an O
average O
of O
33.67% O
of O
the O
time, O
while O
coniine-treated O
chicks O
were O
only O
moving O
8.95% O
of O
a O
5-min O
interval, O
and O
no O
movement O
was O
observed O
for O
nicotine O
sulfate O
treated O
chicks. O
In O
summary, O
the O
chick O
embryo O
provides O
a O
reliable O
and O
simple O
experimental O
animal O
model O
of O
coniine-induced O
arthrogryposis. O
Data O
from O
this O
model O
support O
a O
mechanism O
involving O
nicotinic O
receptor O
blockade O
with O
subsequent O
decreased O
fetal O
movement. O

In O
a O
6-week O
double-blind O
parallel O
treatment O
study, O
dothiepin O
and O
amitriptyline O
were O
compared O
to O
placebo O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
33 O
depressed B
outpatients. O
Dothiepin O
and O
amitriptyline O
were O
equally O
effective O
in O
alleviating O
the O
symptoms O
of O
depressive B
illness, I
and O
both O
were O
significantly O
superior O
to O
placebo. O
The O
overall O
incidence O
of O
side O
effects O
and O
the O
frequency O
and O
severity O
of O
blurred B
vision, I
dry B
mouth, I
and O
drowsiness O
were O
significantly O
less O
with O
dothiepin O
than O
with O
amitriptyline. O
Dothiepin O
also O
produced O
fewer O
CNS O
and O
cardiovascular O
effects. O
There O
were O
no O
clinically O
important O
changes O
in O
laboratory O
parameters. O
Dothiepin O
thus O
was O
found O
to O
be O
an O
effective O
antidepressant O
drug O
associated O
with O
fewer O
side O
effects O
than O
amitriptyline O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
depressed O
outpatients. O

Although O
the O
United O
States O
Food O
and O
Drug O
Administration O
banned O
its O
use O
for O
nocturnal B
leg I
cramps I
due O
to O
lack O
of O
safety O
and O
efficacy, O
quinine O
is O
widely O
available O
in O
beverages O
including O
tonic O
water O
and O
bitter O
lemon. O
Numerous O
anecdotal O
reports O
suggest O
that O
products O
containing O
quinine O
may O
produce O
neurological B
complications, I
including O
confusion, B
altered O
mental O
status, O
seizures, B
and O
coma, B
particularly O
in O
older O
women. O
Psychologists O
need O
to O
inquire O
about O
consumption O
of O
quinine-containing O
beverages O
as O
part O
of O
an O
evaluation O
process. O

Pneumocystis B
pneumonia I
(PCP), O
a B
common O
opportunistic B
infection I
in O
HIV-infected B
individuals, O
is O
generally O
treated O
with O
high O
doses O
of O
co-trimoxazole. O
However, O
treatment O
is O
often O
limited O
by O
adverse O
effects. O
Here, O
we O
report O
two O
cases O
of O
severely O
immunocompromised O
HIV-infected O
patients O
who O
developed O
severe O
intrahepatic B
cholestasis, I
and O
in O
one O
patient O
lesions O
mimicking O

formation O
on O
radiologic O
exams, O
during O
co-trimoxazole O
treatment O
for O

Whereas O
patient O

showed O
lesions O
of O
up O
to O
1 O
cm O
readily O
detectable O
on O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
under O
prolonged O
co-trimoxazole O
treatment, O

Five O
patients O
receiving O
fluoxetine O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
obsessive B
compulsive I
disorder I
or O
major B
depression I
developed O
akathisia. B
The O
typical O
fluoxetine-induced O
symptoms O
of O
restlessness, O
constant O
pacing, O
purposeless O
movements O
of O
the O
feet O
and O
legs, O
and O
marked O
anxiety B
were O
indistinguishable O
from O
those O
of O
neuroleptic-induced O
akathisia. O
Three O
patients O
who O
had O
experienced O
neuroleptic-induced O
akathisia O
in O
the O
past O
reported O
that O
the O
symptoms O
of O
fluoxetine-induced O
akathisia O
were O
identical, O
although O
somewhat O
milder. O
Akathisia B
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
common O
side O
effect O
of O
fluoxetine O
and O
generally O
responded O
well O
to O
treatment O
with O
the O
beta-adrenergic O
antagonist O
propranolol, O
dose O
reduction, O
or O
both. O
The O
authors O
suggest O
that O
fluoxetine-induced O
akathisia O
may O
be O
caused O
by O
serotonergically O
mediated O
inhibition O
of O
dopaminergic O
neurotransmission O
and O
that O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
fluoxetine-induced O
akathisia O
and O
tricyclic O
antidepressant-induced O
"jitteriness" O
may O
be O
identical. O

The O
antiarrhythmic O
effects O
of O
the O
sustained O
release O
form O
of O
mexiletine O
(Mexitil-Perlongets) O
were O
evaluated O
in O
a O
double-blind O
placebo O
trial O
in O
630 O
patients O
with O
recent O
documented O
myocardial B
infarction. I
The O
primary O
response O
variable O
was O
based O
on O
central O
reading O
of O
24 O
hour O
ambulatory O
electrocardiographic O
recordings O
and O
was O
defined O
as O
the O
occurrence O
of O
30 O
or O
more O
single O
premature O
ventricular O
complexes O
in O
any O
two O
consecutive O
30 O
minute O
blocks O
or O
one O
or O
more O
runs O
of O
two O
or O
more O
premature O
ventricular O
complexes O
in O
the O
entire O
24 O
hour O
electrocardiographic O
recording. O
Large O
differences, O
regarded O
as O
statistically O
significant, O
between O
the O
mexiletine O
and O
placebo O
groups O
were O
noted O
in O
that O
end O
point O
at O
months O
1 O
and O
4, O
but O
only O
trends O
were O
observed O
at O
month O
12. O
These O
differences O
were O
observed O
even O
though O
the O
serum O
mexiletine O
levels O
obtained O
in O
this O
study O
were O
generally O
lower O
than O
those O
observed O
in O
studies O
that O
have O
used O
the O
regular O
form O
of O
the O
drug. O
There O
were O
more O
deaths B
in O
the O
mexiletine O
group O
(7.6%) O
than O
in O
the O
placebo O
group O
(4.8%); O
the O
difference O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
The O
incidence O
of O
coronary O
events O
was O
similar O
in O
both O
groups. O
Previously O
recognized O
side O
effects, O
particularly O
tremor B
and O
gastrointestinal B
problems, I
were O
more O
frequent O
in O
the O
mexiletine O
group O
than O
in O
the O
placebo O
group. O

Omeprazole O
is O
the O
first O
drug O
designed O
to O
block O
the O
final O
step O
in O
the O
acid O
secretory O
process O
within O
the O
parietal O
cell. O
It O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
extremely O
effective O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
peptic B
ulcer I
disease, I
reflux B
esophagitis, I
and O
the O
Zollinger-Ellison B
syndrome. I
Although O
clinical O
experience O
with O
omeprazole O
is O
still O
limited, O
many O
controlled O
studies O
have O
established O
the O
short-term O
safety O
of O
this O
drug. O
We O
report O
the O
first O
case O
of O
a O
serious O
short-term O
adverse O
reaction O
with O
the O
use O
of O
omeprazole: O
hemolytic B
anemia. I
The O
patient O
developed O
weakness, O
lethargy, B
and O
shortness B
of I
breath I
2 O
days O
after O
starting O
therapy O
with O
omeprazole. O
Two O
weeks O
after O
the O
initiation O
of O
therapy, O
her O
hematocrit O
had O
decreased O
from O
44.1% O
to O
20.4%, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
positive O
direct O
Coombs O
antiglobulin O
test O
and O
an O
elevated O
indirect O
bilirubin. O
After O
she O
discontinued O
the O
omeprazole, O
her O
hemoglobin O
and O
hematocrit O
gradually O
returned O
to O
normal. O
The O
mechanism O
by O
which O
omeprazole O
caused O
the O
patient's O
hemolytic O
anemia O
is O
uncertain, O
but O
physicians O
should O
be O
alerted O
to O
this O
possible O
adverse O
effect. O

Six O
epidemiologic O
studies O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Europe O
indicate O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
phenacetin O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
chronic B
renal I
failure I
and O
end-stage B
renal I
disease I
(ESRD), O
with B
a O
relative O
risk O
in O
the O
range O
of O
4 O
to O
19. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
these O
and O
other O
studies, O
phenacetin O
has O
now O
been O
withdrawn O
from O
the O
market O
in O
most O
countries. O
However, O
three O
case O
control O
studies, O
one O
each O
in O
North O
Carolina, O
northern O
Maryland, O
and O
West O
Berlin, O
Germany, O
showed O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
is O
also O
associated O
with O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
and O
ESRD, O
with O
a O
relative O
risk O
in O
the O
range O
of O
2 O
to O
4. O
These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
both O
phenacetin O
and O
acetaminophen O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
burden O
of O
ESRD, O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
the O
latter O
being O
somewhat O
less O
than O
that O
of O
the O
former. O
This O
apparent O
difference O
in O
risk O
may O
not O
be O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
nephrotoxic B
potential O
of O
the O
drugs O
themselves. O
A O
lower O
relative O
risk O
would O
be O
expected O
for O
acetaminophen O
if O
the O
risk O
of O
both O
drugs O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics O
was O
higher O
than O
the O
risk O
of O
either O
agent O
alone. O
Thus, O
acetaminophen O
has O
been O
used O
both O
as O
a O
single O
agent O
and O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics, O
whereas O
phenacetin O
was O
available O
only O
in O
combinations. O
The O
possibility O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
alone O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
ESRD O
has O
not O
been O
clearly O
demonstrated, O
but O
cannot O
be O
dismissed. O

Cardiac B
toxicity I
is O
a O
major O
complication O
which O
limits O
the O
use O
of O
adriamycin O
as O

agent. O
Cardiomyopathy B
is O
frequent O
when O
the O

occurs O
within O
one O
to O
six O
months O
after O

is O
reported O
who O
developed O
progressive O
cardiomyopathy B
two O

Ranitidine O
frequently O
is O

This O
drug O
occasionally O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
acute O
interstitial B
nephritis I
in O
native O
kidneys. O
There O
are O
no O
similar O
reports O
with O

We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
ranitidine-induced O
acute O

in O
a O
recipient O
of O
a O
cadaveric O

presenting O
with O
acute O

dysfunction O
within O
48 O
hours O
of O
exposure O
to O
the O
drug. O
The O
biopsy O
specimen O
showed O
pathognomonic O
features, O
including O
eosinophilic O
infiltration O
of O

which O
developed O
in O

on O
long-term O

Such O
patients O
should O
be O
under O
close O
follow-up, O
preferably O
with O
periodic O
ultrasound O
examination O
of O
the O
liver. O
If O
the O
patient O
develops O
a O
liver B
mass, I
because O
of O
non-specific O
clinical O
features O
and O

may O
be O
the O
only O
way O
to O

Thermal O

Adriamycin-mediated O

and O
normal O

by O
whole O
body O
hyperthermia B
were O
compared O
using O
a O
F344 O
rat O
model. O
Antitumor O
activity O
was O
studied O
using O
a O
tumor O

assay. O
Acute O

(i.e., O
myocardial B
and I
kidney B
injury) I
were O
evaluated O
by O
functional/physiological O
assays O
and O
by O
morphological O
techniques. O
Whole O
body O
hyperthermia O
(120 O
min O
at O
41.5 O
degrees O
C) O
enhanced O
both O
Adriamycin-mediated O
antitumor O
activity O
and O
toxic O
side O
effects. O
The O
thermal O
enhancement O
ratio O
calculated O
for O
antitumor O
activity O
was O
1.6. O
Thermal O
enhancement O
ratios O
estimated O
for O
"acute" O
hematological O
changes O
were O
1.3, O
whereas O
those O
estimated O
for O
"late" O
damage O
(based O
on O
morphological O
cardiac B
and I
renal B
lesions) I
varied O
between O
2.4 O
and O
4.3. O
Thus, O
while O
whole O
body O
hyperthermia O
enhances O
Adriamycin-mediated O
antitumor O
effect, O
normal O
tissue O
toxicity B
is O
also O
increased, O
and O
the O

Warfarin O
is O
the O
most O
widely O
used O
oral O
anticoagulant O
and O
is O
indicated O
for O
many O

Levofloxacin, O
a O
fluoroquinolone, O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
commonly O
prescribed O
antibiotics O
in O
clinical O
practice O
and O
is O
effective O
against O
Gram-positive, O
Gram-negative, O
and O

bacteria. O
While O
small O
prospective O
studies O
have O
not O
revealed O
any O
significant O
drug-drug O
interaction O
between O
warfarin O
and O
levofloxacin, O
several O
case O
reports O
have O
indicated O
that O
levofloxacin O
may O
significantly O
potentiate O
the O
anticoagulation O
effect O
of O
warfarin. O
We O
report O
3 O
cases O

bleeding B
complications O
that O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
result O
of O
the O
interaction O
between O
warfarin O

report O
2 O
cases O

investigate O
its O
mechanism, O
and O
compare O
the O

CASE O
SUMMARIES: O
Two O
patients O
developed O
prolonged O
cholestatic O
hepatitis O
after O
receiving O
ticlopidine O
following O
percutaneous O
coronary O
angioplasty, O
with O
complete O
remission O
during O
the O
follow-up O
period. O
T-cell O
stimulation O
by O
therapeutic O
concentration O
of O
ticlopidine O
was O
demonstrated O
in O
vitro O
in O
the O
patients, O
but O
not O
in O
healthy O
controls. O
DISCUSSION: O
Cholestatic B
hepatitis I
is O
a O
rare O
complication O
of O
the O
antiplatelet O
agent O
ticlopidine; O
several O
cases O
have O
been O
reported O
but O
few O
in O
the O
English O
literature. O
Our O
patients O
developed O
jaundice B
following O
treatment O
with O
ticlopidine O
and O
showed O
the O
clinical O
and O
laboratory O
characteristics O
of O
cholestatic O
hepatitis, O
which O
resolved O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
drug. O
Hepatitis B
may O
develop O
weeks O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
drug O
and O
may O
run O
a O
prolonged O
course, O
but O
complete O
remission O
was O
observed O
in O
all O
reported O
cases. O
An O
objective O
causality O
assessment O
revealed O
that O
the O
adverse O
drug O
event O
was O
probably O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
ticlopidine. O
The O
mechanisms O
of O
this O
ticlopidine-induced O
cholestasis B
are O
unclear. O
Immune O
mechanisms O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
drug's O
hepatotoxicity, B
as O
suggested O
by O
the O
T-cell O
stimulation O
study O
reported O
here. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Cholestatic O
hepatitis O
is O
a O
rare O
adverse O
effect O
of O
ticlopidine O
that O
may O
be O
immune O
mediated. O
Patients O
receiving O
the O
drug O
should O
be O
monitored O
with O
liver O
function O
tests O
along O
with O
complete O
blood O
cell O
counts. O
This O
complication O
will O
be O
observed O
even O
less O
often O
in O
the O
future O
as O
ticlopidine O
is O
being O
replaced O
by O
the O
newer O
antiplatelet O
agent O
clopidogrel. O

BACKGROUND: O
TEE O
is O
a O
semi-invasive O
tool O
broadly O
used O
and O
its O
utilization O
associated O
to O
sedatives O
drugs O
might O
to O
affect O
the O
procedure O
safety. O
OBJECTIVE: O
to O
analyze O
aspects O
of O
TEE O
safety O
associated O
to O
the O
use O
of O
Midazolan O
(MZ) O
and O
Flumazenil O
(FL) O
and O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
clinical O
variables O
on O
the O

rate. O
METHOD: O
prospective O
study O
with O
137 O
patients O
that O
underwent O
TEE O
with O
MZ O
associated O
to O
moderate O
sedation. O
We O
analyzed O
the O
following O
events: O
complications O
related O
with O
the O
topical O
anesthesia, O
with O
MZ O
use O
and O
with O
the O
procedure. O
Uni- O
and O
multivariate O
analyses O
were O
used O
to O
test O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
clinical O
variables: O
age, O
sex, O
stroke, B
myocardiopathy B
(MP), O
duration B
of O
the O
test, O
mitral B
regurgitation I
(MR) O
and B
the O
MZ O
dose. O
RESULTS: O
All O
patients O
(65+/-16 O
yrs; O
58% O
males) O
finished O
the O
examination. O
The O
mean O
doses O
of O
MZ O
and O
FL O
were O
4.3+/-1.9 O
mg O
and O
0.28+/-0.2 O
mg, O
respectively. O
The O
duration O
of O
the O
examination O
and O
the O
mean O
ejection O
fraction O
(EF) O
were O
16.4+/-6.1 O
minutes O
and O
60+/-9%, O
respectively. O
Mild O
hypoxia B
(SO2<90%) O
was O
the O
most O
common O
event O
(11 O
patients); O
3 O
patients O
(2%) O
presented O
transient O
hypoxia O
due O
to O
upper O
airway B
obstruction I
by O
probe O
introduction O
and O
8 O
(5.8%) O
due O
to O
hypoxia O
caused O
by O
MZ O
use. O
Transient O
hypotension B
(SAP<90mmHg) O
occurred O
in O
1 O
patient O
(0.7%). O
The O
multivariate O
analysis O
showed O
that O
severe O
MR, O
MP O
(EF<45%) O
and O
high O
doses O
of O
MZ O
(>5mg) O
were O
associated O
with O
events O
(p<0.001). O
The O
EF O
was O
40%, O
in O
the O
group O
with O
MP O
and O
44% O
in O
the O
group O
with O
severe O
MR O
and O
it O
can O
be O
a O
factor O
associated O
with O
clinical O
events O
in O
the O
last O
group. O
CONCLUSION: O
TEE O
with O
sedation O
presents O
a O
low O
rate O
of O
events. O
There O
were O
no O
severe O
events O
and O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
interrupt O
the O
examinations. O

and O
6 O
and O
12 O
months O
after O
treatment O
with O
mazindol O
(3 O

Mazindol O
did O
not O
benefit O

(22%), O
and O
gastrointestinal B
symptoms I
(18%); O
mazindol O
dosage O
was O
reduced O
in O
43% O

METHODS: O
We O
sent O
a O
questionnaire O
concerning O

to O
32 O
institutions O
in O
Japan, O
which O
were O
selected O
on O

or O
both O
was O
performed O
at O
13 O

For O
three O
patients, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
not O
to O
proceed O
with O

The O
dosage O
of O
indocyanine O
green O
used O
for O
angiography O
varied O
from O
25 O
to O
75 O
mg, O
depending O
upon O
the O
institution. O
There O
were O
13 O
cases O
of O
adverse O
reactions O
(0.34%), O
ten O
of O
which O
were O
mild O
reactions O
such O
as O
nausea, B
exanthema, B
urtication, B
itchiness, B
and O

Also O
recorded O
were O
one O
case O

The O
side O
effect O
profiles O
of O
the O
atypical O
antipsychotics O
are O
more O
advantageous O
than O
those O
of O
the O
conventional O
neuroleptics. O
Conventional O
agents O
are O
associated O
with O
unwanted O
central O
nervous O
system O
effects, O
including O
extrapyramidal B
symptoms I
(EPS), O
tardive B
dyskinesia, I
sedation, O
and O
possible O
impairment O
of O
some O
cognitive O
measures, O
as O
well O
as O
cardiac O
effects, O
orthostatic B
hypotension, I
hepatic O
changes, O
anticholinergic O
side O
effects, O
sexual B
dysfunction, I
and O
weight B
gain. I
The O
newer O
atypical O
agents O
have O
a O
lower O
risk O
of O
EPS, O
but O
are O
associated O
in O
varying O
degrees O
with O
sedation, O
cardiovascular O
effects, O
anticholinergic O
effects, O
weight O
gain, O
sexual O
dysfunction, O
hepatic O
effects, O
lowered O
seizure B
threshold O
(primarily O
clozapine), O
and O
agranulocytosis B
(clozapine O
only). O
Since O
the O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
specific O
adverse O
effects O
differ O
among O
the O
various O
atypicals, O
the O
clinician O
should O
carefully O
consider O
which O
side O
effects O
are O
most O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
the O
individual's O
dissatisfaction O
and O
noncompliance O
before O
choosing O
an O
antipsychotic O
for O
a O
particular O
patient. O

1 O

Total O

were O
36 O

of O
ifosfamide O
(six O

of O
ifosfamide, O

None O
of O
them O
had O
received O

Ages O
ranged O
from O
4 O
months O
to O
17 O
years; O
58 O
patients O
were O
males O
and O
42 O
females. O
The O
most O
common O
primary O
tumor O
site O
was O
the O
head O
and O
neck. O
Renal O
function O
was O
investigated O
by O
measuring O
plasma O
and O
urinary O
electrolytes, O
glucosuria, B
proteinuria, B
aminoaciduria, B
urinary O
pH, O
osmolarity, O
creatinine O
clearance, O
phosphate O
tubular O
reabsorption, O
beta O

microglobulinuria, O
and O
lysozymuria. O
Fifty-eight O
patients O
(78%) O
had O
normal O
renal O
tests, O
whereas O
16 O
patients O
(22%) O
had O
renal B
abnormalities. I
Two O
subsets O
of O
patients O
were O
identified O
from O
this O
latter O
group: O
the O
first O
included O
four O
patients O
(5% O
of O
the O
total O
population) O
who O
developed O
major O
toxicity B
resulting O
in O
Fanconi's B
syndrome I
(TDFS); O
and B
the O
second O
group O
included O
five O
patients O
with O
elevated O
beta O
2 O
microglobulinuria O
and O
low O
phosphate O
reabsorption. O
The O
remaining O
seven O
patients O
had O
isolated O
beta O
2 O
microglobulinuria. O
Severe O
toxicity O
was O
correlated O
with O
the O
higher O
cumulative O
dose O
of O
60 O
g/m2 O
of O
ifosfamide, O
a O
younger O
age O
(less O
than O
2 O
1/2 O
years O
old), O
and O
a O
predominance O
of O
vesicoprostatic O
tumor O
involvement. O
This O
low O
percentage O
(5%) O
of O
TDFS O
must O
be O
evaluated O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
efficacy O
of O
ifosfamide O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
mesenchymal O

in O

Clinical O
and O
experimental O
data O
published O
to O
date O
suggest O
several O
possible O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
cocaine O
may O
result O
in O
acute B
myocardial I
infarction. B
In O
individuals O
with O
preexisting, O
high-grade O
coronary O
arterial O
narrowing, O
acute O
myocardial O
infarction O
may O
result O
from O
an O
increase O
in O
myocardial O
oxygen O
demand O
associated O
with O
cocaine-induced O
increase O
in O
rate-pressure O
product. O
In O
other O
individuals O
with O
no O
underlying O
atherosclerotic B
obstruction, I
coronary B
occlusion I
may O
be O
due O
to O
spasm, B
thrombus, B
or O
both. O
With O
regard O
to O
spasm, O
the O
clinical O
findings O
are O
largely O
circumstantial, O
and O
the O
locus O
of O
cocaine-induced O
vasoconstriction O
remains O
speculative. O
Although O
certain O
clinical O
and O
experimental O
findings O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
spasm O
involves O
the O
epicardial, O
medium-size O
vessels, O
other O
data O
suggest O
intramural O
vasoconstriction. O
Diffuse O
intramural O
vasoconstriction O
is O
not O
consistent O
with O
reports O
of O
segmental, O
discrete O
infarction. O
Whereas O
certain O
in O
vivo O
data O
suggest O
that O
these O
effects O
are O
alpha-mediated, O
other O
in O
vitro O
data O
suggest O
the O
opposite. O
The O
finding O
of O
cocaine-induced O
vasoconstriction O
in O
segments O
of O
(noninnervated) O
human O
umbilical O
artery O
suggests O
that O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
intact O
innervation O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
explain O
the O
discrepant O
data O
involving O
the O
possibility O
of O
alpha-mediated O
effects. O
Finally, O
the O
contribution O
of O
a O
primary, O
thrombotic B
effect O
of O
cocaine O
has O
not O
been O
excluded. O

Mitochondrial B
abnormalities I
have O
been O
associated O
with O
several O
aspects O
of O
epileptogenesis, O
such O
as O
energy O
generation, O
control O
of O
cell O
death, B
neurotransmitter O
synthesis, O
and O
free O
radical O
(FR) O
production. O
Increased O
production O
of O
FRs O
may O
cause O
mtDNA O
damage O
leading O
to O
decreased O
activities O
of O
oxidative O
phosphorylation O
complexes O
containing O
mtDNA-encoded O
subunits. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
whether O
increased O
generation O
of O
FR O
during O
status B
epilepticus I
would O
be O
sufficient O
to O
provoke O
abnormalities O
in O
mtDNA O
and O
in O
the O
expression O
and O
activity O
of O
cytochrome O
c O
oxidase O
(CCO), O

IV O
of O
the O
respiratory O
chain, O
in O
the O
chronic O
phase O
of O
the O
pilocarpine O
model O
of O
temporal B
lobe I
epilepsy. I
DNA O
analysis O
revealed O
low O
amounts O
of O
a O
4.8 O
kb O
mtDNA O
deletion O
but O
with O
no O
differences O
in O
frequency O
or O
quantity O
in O
the O
control O
and O
experimental O
groups. O
We O
did O
not O
find O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
expression O
and O
distribution O
of O
an O
mtDNA-encoded O
subunit O
of O
CCO O
(CCO-I) O
or O
a O
relative O
decrease O
in O
CCO-I O
when O
compared O
with O
nuclear-encoded O
subunits O
(CCO-IV O
and O
SDH-fp). O
No O
abnormality O
in O
CCO O
activity O
was O
observed O
through O
histochemistry. O
Although O
evidences O
of O
mitochondrial B
abnormalities I
were O
found O
in O
previously O
published O
studies, O
our O
results O
do O
not O
suggest O
that O
the O
FRs, O
generated O
during O
the O
acute O
phase, O
determined O
important O
abnormalities O
in O
mtDNA, O
in O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
study O
tremor B
side O
effects O
of O
salbutamol O
an O
easily O
applicable, O
quick O
and O
low-priced O
method O
is O
needed. O
A O
new O
method O
using O
a O
commercially O
available, O
pen-shaped O
laser O
pointer O
was O
developed. O
Aim O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
sensitivity, O
reproducibility, O
reference O
values O
and O
the O
agreement O
with O
a O
questionnaire. O
METHODS: O
Tremor B
was O
measured O
using O
a O
laser O
pointer O
technique. O
To O
determine O
sensitivity O
we O
assessed O
tremor O
in O
44 O
patients O
with O
obstructive B
lung I
disease I
after O
administration O
of O
cumulative O
doses O
of O
salbutamol. O
Subjects O
were O
asked O
to O
aim O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
a O
target, O
subdivided O
in O
concentric O
circles, O
from O
5 O
m O
distance. O
The O
circle O
in O
which O
the O
participant O
succeeded O
to O
aim O
was O
recorded O
in O
millimetres O
radius. O
In O
another O
series O
of O
measurements, O
reproducibility O
and O
reference O
values O
of O
the O
tremor O
was O
assessed O
in O
65 O
healthy O
subjects O
in O
three O
sessions, O
at O
9 O
a.m., O
4 O
p.m. O
and O
9 O
a.m., O
respectively, O
1 O
week O
later. O
Postural O
tremor O
was O
measured O
with O
the O
arm O
horizontally O
outstretched O
rest O
tremor O
with O
the O
arm O
supported O
by O
an O
armrest O
and O
finally O
tremor O
was O
measured O
after O
holding O
a O
2-kg O
weight O
until O
exhaustion. O
Inter-observer O
variability O
was O
measured O
in O
a O
series O
of O
10 O
healthy O
subjects. O
Tremor O
was O
measured O
simultaneously O
by O
two O
independent O
observers. O
RESULTS: O
Salbutamol O
significantly O
increased O
tremor O
severity O
in O
patients O
in O
a O
dose-dependent O
way. O
Within O
healthy O
adults O
no O
age-dependency O
could O
be O
found O
(b O
= O
0.262 O
mm/year; O
P O
= O
0.72). O
There O
was O
no O
agreement O
between O
the O
questionnaire O
and O
tremor O
severity O
(r O
= O
0.093; O
P O
= O
0.53). O
Postural O
tremor O
showed O
no O
significant O
difference O
between O
the O
first O
and O
third O
session O
(P O
= O
0.07). O
Support O
of O
the O
arm O
decreased O
tremor O
severity, O
exhaustion O
increased O
tremor O
severity O
significantly. O
A O
good O
agreement O
was O
found O
between O
two O
independent O
observers O
(interclass O
correlation O
coefficient O
0.72). O
DISCUSSION: O
Quantifying O
tremor O
by O
using O
an O
inexpensive O
laser O
pointer O
is, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
children O
(<12 O
years) O
a O
sensitive O
and O
reproducible O
method. O

While O
there O
is O
no O
single O
correct O
starting O
dose O
for O
levodopa O
therapy, O
many O
individuals O
can O
be O
started O
on O
either O
the O
25/100 O
or O
controlled-release O
formula, O
following O
the O
general O
rule O
not O
to O
attempt O
to O
titrate O
carbidopa-levodopa O
to O
the O
point O
of O
"normality," O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
toxicity. B
The O
physician O
should O
also O
determine O
the O
proper O
use O
of O
any O
adjunctive O
medications; O
such O
combined O
therapy O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
approach O
to O
treatment. O
Following O
the O
initial O
period O
of O
therapy, O
emerging O
difficulties O
require O
a O
reassessment O
of O
therapeutic O
approaches, O
such O
as O
dosage O
adjustment O
or O
introduction O
of O
a O
dopamine O
agonist. O
Other O
possible O
adverse O
effects--such O
as O
gastrointestinal B
disorders, I
orthostatic B
hypotension, I
levodopa-induced O
psychosis, B
sleep B
disturbances I
or O
parasomnias, B
or O
drug O
interactions--also O
require O
carefully O
monitored O
individual O
treatment. O
Nonpharmacologic O
concerns O
can O
help O
the O
Parkinson's B
disease I
patient O
achieve O
and O
maintain O
optimal O
functioning, O
including O
daily O
exercise, O
physical O
therapy, O
and O
involvement O
with O
support O
groups. O

The O
present O
studies O
demonstrate O
that O
growth O
and O
vitamin O
D O
treatment O
enhance O
the O
extent O
of O
artery B
calcification B
in O
rats O
given O
sufficient O
doses O
of O
Warfarin O
to O
inhibit O
gamma-carboxylation O
of O
matrix O
Gla O
protein, O
a O
calcification O
inhibitor O
known O
to O
be O
expressed O
by O
smooth O
muscle O
cells O
and O
macrophages O
in O
the O
artery O
wall. O
The O
first O
series O
of O
experiments O
examined O
the O
influence O
of O
age O
and O
growth O
status O
on O
artery O
calcification O
in O
Warfarin-treated O
rats. O
Treatment O
for O
2 O
weeks O
with O
Warfarin O
caused O
massive O
focal O
calcification B
of I
the I
artery I
media O
in O
20-day-old O
rats O
and O
less O
extensive O
focal O
calcification O
in O
42-day-old O
rats. O
In O
contrast, O
no O
artery O
calcification O
could O
be O
detected O
in O
10-month-old O
adult O
rats O
even O
after O
4 O
weeks O
of O
Warfarin O
treatment. O
To O
directly O
examine O
the O
importance O
of O
growth O
to O
Warfarin-induced O
artery O
calcification O
in O
animals O
of O
the O
same O
age, O
20-day-old O
rats O
were O
fed O
for O
2 O
weeks O
either O
an O
ad O
libitum O
diet O
or O
a O
6-g/d O
restricted O
diet O
that O
maintains O
weight O
but O
prevents O
growth. O
Concurrent O
treatment O
of O
both O
dietary O
groups O
with O
Warfarin O
produced O
massive O
focal O
calcification O
of O
the O
artery O
media O
in O
the O
ad O
libitum-fed O
rats O
but O
no O
detectable O
artery O
calcification O
in O
the O
restricted-diet, O
growth-inhibited O
group. O
Although O
the O
explanation O
for O
the O
association O
between O
artery O
calcification O
and O
growth O
status O
cannot O
be O
determined O
from O
the O
present O
study, O
there O
was O
a O
relationship O
between O
higher O
serum O
phosphate O
and O
susceptibility O
to O
artery O
calcification, O
with O
30% O
higher O
levels O
of O
serum O
phosphate O
in O
young, O
ad O
libitum-fed O
rats O
compared O
with O
either O
of O
the O
groups O
that O
was O
resistant O
to O
Warfarin-induced O
artery O
calcification, O
ie, O
the O
10-month-old O
rats O
and O
the O
restricted-diet, O
growth-inhibited O
young O
rats. O
This O
observation O
suggests O
that O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
Warfarin-induced O
artery O
calcification O
could O
be O
related O
to O
higher O
serum O
phosphate O
levels. O
The O
second O
set O
of O
experiments O
examined O
the O
possible O
synergy O
between O
vitamin O
D O
and O
Warfarin O
in O
artery O
calcification. O
High O
doses O
of O
vitamin O
D O
are O
known O
to O
cause O
calcification O
of O
the O
artery O
media O
in O
as O
little O
as O
3 O
to O
4 O
days. O
High O
doses O
of O
the O
vitamin O
K O
antagonist O
Warfarin O
are O
also O
known O
to O
cause O
calcification O
of O
the O
artery O
media, O
but O
at O
treatment O
times O
of O
2 O
weeks O
or O
longer O
yet O
not O
at O
1 O
week. O
In O
the O
current O
study, O
we O
investigated O
the O
synergy O
between O
these O
2 O
treatments O
and O
found O
that O
concurrent O
Warfarin O
administration O
dramatically O
increased O
the O
extent O
of O
calcification O
in O
the O
media O
of O
vitamin O
D-treated O
rats O
at O
3 O
and O
4 O
days. O
There O
was O
a O
close O
parallel O
between O
the O
effect O
of O
vitamin O
D O
dose O
on O
artery O
calcification O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
vitamin O
D O
dose O
on O
the O
elevation O
of O
serum O
calcium, O
which O
suggests O
that O
vitamin O
D O
may O
induce O
artery O
calcification O
through O
its O
effect O
on O
serum O
calcium. O
Because O
Warfarin O
treatment O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
the O
elevation O
in O
serum O
calcium O
produced O
by O
vitamin O
D, O
the O
synergy O
between O
Warfarin O
and O
vitamin O
D O
is O
probably O
best O
explained O
by O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
Warfarin O
inhibits O
the O
activity O
of O
matrix O
Gla O
protein O
as O
a O
calcification O
inhibitor. O
High O
levels O
of O
matrix O
Gla O
protein O
are O
found O
at O
sites O
of O
artery O
calcification O
in O
rats O
treated O
with O
vitamin O
D O
plus O
Warfarin, O
and O
chemical O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
protein O
that O
accumulated O
was O
indeed O
not O
gamma-carboxylated. O
These O
observations O
indicate O
that O
although O
the O
gamma-carboxyglutamate O
residues O
of O
matrix O
Gla O
protein O
are O
apparently O
required O
for O
its O
function O
as O
a O
calcification O
inhibitor, O
they O
are O
not O
required O
for O
its O
accumulation O
at O
calcification O
sites. O

A O
case O
of O
genuine O
stress B
incontinence B
due O
to O
prazosin, O
a O
common O
antihypertensive O
drug, O
is O
presented. O
Prazosin O
exerts O
its O
antihypertensive O
effects O
through O
vasodilatation O
caused O
by O

STUDY O
OBJECTIVE: O
We O
sought O
to O
compare O
the O
rate O
of O
akathisia B
after O
administration O
of O
intravenous O
prochlorperazine O
as O
a O
2-minute O
bolus O
or O
15-minute O
infusion. O
METHODS: O
We O
conducted O
a O
prospective, O
randomized, O
double-blind O
study O
in O
the O
emergency O
department O
of O
a O
central-city O
teaching O
hospital. O
Patients O
aged O
18 O
years O
or O
older O
treated O
with O
prochlorperazine O
for O
headache, B
nausea, B
or O
vomiting B
were O
eligible O
for O
inclusion. O
Study O
participants O
were O
randomized O
to O
receive O
10 O
mg O
of O
prochlorperazine O
administered O
intravenously O
by O
means O
of O
2-minute O
push O
(bolus O

or O
10 O
mg O
diluted O
in O
50 O
mL O
of O
normal O
saline O
solution O
administered O
by O
means O
of O
intravenous O
infusion O
during O
a O
15-minute O
period O
(infusion O
group). O
The O
main O
outcome O
was O
the O
number O
of O
study O
participants O
experiencing O
akathisia O
within O
60 O
minutes O
of O
administration. O
Akathisia O
was O
defined O
as O
either O
a O
spontaneous O
report O
of O
restlessness O
or O
agitation B
or O
a O
change O
of O
2 O
or O
more O
in O
the O
patient-reported O
akathisia O
rating O
scale O
and O
a O
change O
of O
at O
least O
1 O
in O
the O
investigator-observed O
akathisia O
rating O
scale. O
The O
intensity O
of O
headache O
and O
nausea O
was O
measured O
with O
a O
100-mm O
visual O
analog O
scale. O
RESULTS: O
One O
hundred O
patients O
were O
enrolled. O
One O
study O
participant O
was O
excluded O
after O
protocol O
violation. O
Seventy-three O
percent O
(73/99) O
of O
the O
study O
participants O
were O
treated O
for O
headache O
and O
70% O
(70/99) O
for O
nausea. O
In O
the O
bolus O
group, O
26.0% O
(13/50) O
had O
akathisia O
compared O
with O
32.7% O
(16/49) O
in O
the O
infusion O
group O
(Delta=-6.7%; O
95% O

[CI] O
-24.6% O
to O
11.2%). O
The O
difference O
between O
the O
bolus O
and O

in O
the O
percentage O
of O
participants O
who O
saw O
a O
50% O
reduction O
in O
their O
headache O
intensity O
within O
30 O
minutes O
was O
11.8% O
(95% O
CI O
-9.6% O

33.3%). O
The O
difference O
in O
the O
percentage O

CONCLUSION: O
A O
50% O
reduction O
in O
the O
incidence O
of O
akathisia O
when O
prochlorperazine O
was O
administered O
by O
means O

of O
the O
procedure, O
Group O
A O
(n O

Postoperatively, O
all O
patients O
were O
assessed O
for O
symptoms O
of O
nausea, B

and O
headache. B
A O
chi-square O
test O
was O
used O
to O
assess O
the O
statistical O
significance O
of O
results. O
RESULTS: O
Sixty O
percent O

Group O
A O
developed O
postoperative B
emetic I
symptoms, I
headache, O
or O
both; O
1 O
patient O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
administration O
of O
methylprednisolone O
and O
gentamicin O
in O
the O
posterior O
sub-Tenon's O
space O
was O
related O
to O
a O
high O

Moreover, O
detailed O

studies O
disclosed O
abnormalities O
in O
7 O
more O

Visual B
toxicity I
was O
of O

origin O
and O
was O
characterized O
by O
a O

sometimes O
associated O
with O
a B

loss I
and O
the O
lesion O
was O
of O

BACKGROUND: O
Cisplatin O
has O
minimal O
antitumor O
activity B
when O
used O
as O
second- O
or O
third-line O
treatment O
of O
metastatic O
breast B
carcinoma. I
Older O
reports O
suggest O
an O
objective O
response O
rate O
of O
8% O
when O
60-120 O
mg/m2 O
of O
cisplatin O
is O
administered O
every O
3-4 O
weeks. O
Although O
a O
dose-response O
effect O
has O
been O
observed O
with O
cisplatin, O
the O
dose-limiting O
toxicities B
associated O
with O
cisplatin O
(e.g., O
nephrotoxicity, B
ototoxicity, B
and O
neurotoxicity) B
have O
limited O
its O
use O
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
breast O
carcinoma. O
WR-2721 O
or O
amifostine O
initially O
was O
developed O
to O
protect O
military O
personnel O
in O
the O
event O
of O
nuclear O
war. O
Amifostine O
subsequently O
was O
shown O
to O
protect O
normal O
tissues O
from O
the O
toxic O
effects O
of O
alkylating O
agents O
and O
cisplatin O
without O
decreasing O
the O
antitumor O
effect O
of O
the O
chemotherapy. O
Early O
trials O
of O
cisplatin O
and O
amifostine O
also O
suggested O
that O
the O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
cisplatin-induced O
nephrotoxicity, O
ototoxicity, O
and O
neuropathy B
were O
reduced. O
METHODS: O
A O
Phase O
II O
study O
of O
the O
combination O
of O
cisplatin O
plus O
amifostine O
was O
conducted O
in O
patients O
with O
progressive O
metastatic O
breast O
carcinoma O
who O
had O
received O
one, O
but O
not O
more O
than O
one, O

disease. O
Patients O
received O
amifostine, O
910 O
mg/m2 O
intravenously O
over O
15 O
minutes. O
After O
completion O
of O
the O
amifostine O
infusion, O
cisplatin O
120 O
mg/m2 O
was O
administered O
over O
30 O
minutes. O
Intravenous O
hydration O
and O
mannitol O
was O
administered O
before O
and O
after O
cisplatin. O
Treatment O
was O
administered O
every O
3 O
weeks O
until O
disease O
progression. O
RESULTS: O
Forty-four O
patients O
were O
enrolled O
in O
the O
study O
of O
which O
7 O
(16%) O
were O
ineligible. O
A O
median O
of O
2 O
cycles O
of O
therapy O
was O
administered O
to O
the O
37 O
eligible O
patients. O
Six O
partial O
responses O
were O
observed O
for O
an O
overall O
response O
rate O
of O
16%. O
Most O
patients O
(57%) O
stopped O
treatment O
because O
of O
disease O
progression. O
Neurologic B
toxicity I
was O
reported O
in O
52% O
of O
patients. O
Seven O
different O
life-threatening O

patients O
while O
receiving O
treatment. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
combination O
of O
cisplatin O
and O
amifostine O
in O
this O
study O
resulted O
in O
an O
overall O
response O
rate O

PERSPECTIVE: O
Study O
findings O
indicate O
that O
the O
metabolism, O
neurocognitive O
effects, O
and O
physical O
side O
effects O
of O
oral O
oxycodone O
are O
similar O
for O
healthy O
middle-aged O
and O
older O
adults. O
Therefore, O
clinicians O
should O
not O
avoid O
prescribing O
oral O
opioids O
to O
older O
adults O
based O
on O
the O
belief O
that O
older O
adults O
are O
at O
higher O
risk O
for O
side O
effects O
than O
younger O
adults. O

We O
report O
an O
undiagnosed O
case O
of O
myotonia B
congenita I
in O
a O
24-year-old O
previously O

following O
a O
standard O
dose O
of O

suxamethonium O
for O

Neither O
the O

nor O
the O
anaesthetist O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
before O
this O
potentially O
lethal O
complication O
occurred. O

Fusidic O
acid O
is O
an O
antibiotic O
with O

effects O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
cyclosporin. O
Because O
of O
the O
need O
for O
the O
development O
of O
new O
treatments O
for O
Crohn's B
disease, I
a O
pilot O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
estimate O
the O
pharmacodynamics O
and O
tolerability O
of O
fusidic O
acid O
treatment O
in O
chronic O
active, O
therapy-resistant O
patients. O
Eight O
Crohn's O
disease O
patients O
were O
included. O
Fusidic O
acid O
was O
administered O
orally O
in O
a O
dose O
of O
500 O
mg O
t.d.s. O
and O
the O
treatment O
was O
planned O
to O
last O
8 O
weeks. O
The O
disease O
activity O
was O
primarily O
measured O
by O
a O
modified O
individual O
grading O
score. O
Five O
of O
8 O
patients O
(63%) O
improved O
during O
fusidic O
acid O
treatment: O
3 O
at O
two O
weeks O
and O
2 O
after O
four O
weeks. O
There O
were O
no O
serious O
clinical O
side O
effects, O
but O
dose O
reduction O
was O
required O
in O
two O
patients O
because O
of O
nausea. B
Biochemically, O
an O
increase O
in O
alkaline O
phosphatases O
was O
noted O
in O
5 O
of O
8 O
cases O
(63%), O
and O
the O
greatest O
increases O
were O
seen O
in O
those O
who O
had O
elevated O
levels O
prior O
to O
treatment. O
All O
reversed O
to O
pre-treatment O
levels O
after O
cessation O
of O
treatment. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
pilot O
study O
suggest O
that O
fusidic O
acid O
may O
be O
of O
benefit O
in O
selected O
chronic O
active O
Crohn's O
disease O
patients O
in O
whom O
conventional O
treatment O
is O
ineffective. O
Because O
there O
seems O
to O
exist O
a O
scientific O
rationale O
for O
the O
use O
of O
fusidic O
acid O
at O
the O
cytokine O
level O
in O
inflammatory B
bowel I
disease, I
we O
suggest O
that O
the O
role O
of O
this O
treatment O
should O
be O
further O
investigated. O

Centrally O

In O
addition O
to O
their O

certain O
adverse O

been O
reported. O
Adults O
chronically O

may O
have O
a O
limited O
ability O

when O
the O

simultaneously O
blocked. O
The O
authors O
present O
a O
10-year-old O
boy O
chronically O
treated O
with O
lisinopril, O
an O
angiotensin O

to O
control O
hypertension B
who O
developed O
hypotension O
following O
the O
addition O
of O
tizanidine, O
an O
alpha-2 O
agonist, O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
spasticity. O
The O
possible O
interaction O
of O
tizanidine O
and O
other O
antihypertensive O
agents O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
mind O
when O
prescribing O
therapy O
to O
treat O
either O
hypertension O
or O
spasticity O
in O
such O
patients. O

We O
report O
the O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
who O
developed O
acute O
hepatitis B
with O
extensive B
hepatocellular I
necrosis, I
7 O
months O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
administration O
of O
clotiazepam, O
a O
thienodiazepine O
derivative. O
Clotiazepam O
withdrawal O
was O
followed O
by O
prompt O
recovery. O
The O
administration O
of O
several O
benzodiazepines, O
chemically O
related O
to O
clotiazepam, O
did O
not O
interfere O
with O
recovery O
and O
did O
not O
induce O
any O
relapse O
of O
hepatitis. O
This O
observation O
shows O
that O
clotiazepam O
can O
induce O
acute O
hepatitis O
and O
suggests O
that O
there O
is O
no O
cross O
hepatotoxicity B
between O
clotiazepam O
and O
several O
benzodiazepines. O

Thirty-four O

who O
were O
treated O
with O

had O
statistically O
significant O
decreases O
from O
baseline O
in O
6 O
arthritis O
indices O
after O
12 O
weeks O
of O
treatment. O
Improvements O
were O
seen O
in O
the O
number O
of O
tender B
joints, I
the O
severity O
of O

the O

50 O
feet, O
the O
duration O
of O
morning B
stiffness I
and O
the O
circumference O
of O

left O
knee. O
The O
most O
frequently O
observed O
side O
effect O
was O
fecal B
occult I
blood I
(25% O
of O
patients); O
however, O
there O
was O
no O
other O
evidence O
of O
gastrointestinal B

in O
these O
patients. O
One O
patient O
was O
prematurely O
discontinued O
from O
the O
study O
for O
severe O
headache B
and O

Most O
side O
effects O
were O
mild O
and O
related O
to O
the O
GI O
tract. O

Neuromuscular O

Reports O
of O
persistent O

after O
the O
discontinuance O
of O
these O

have O
most O
often O
involved O
aminosteroid-based O
NMBAs O
such O
as O
vecuronium O
bromide, O
especially O
when O
used O
in O

a O
short-acting O
benzylisoquinolinium O
NMBA O
that O
is O
eliminated O
independently O
of O
renal O
or O
hepatic O
function, O
has O
also O
been O
associated O
with O
persistent O
paralysis, O
but O
only O
when O
used O
with O
corticosteroids. O
We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
atracurium-related O
paralysis O
persisting O
for O
approximately O
50 O
hours O
in O

Rg1, O
as O
a O
ginsenoside O
extracted O
from O
Panax O
ginseng, O
could O
ameliorate O
spatial O
learning B
impairment. I
Previous O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
Rg1 O
might O
be O
a O
useful O
agent O
for O
the O
prevention O
and O
treatment O
of O
the O
adverse O
effects O
of O
morphine. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
Rg1 O
on O
learning O
impairment O
by O
chronic O
morphine O
administration O
and O
the O
mechanism O
responsible O
for O
this O
effect. O
Male O
rats O
were O
subcutaneously O
injected O
with O
morphine O
(10 O
mg/kg) O
twice O
a O
day O
at O
12 O
hour O
intervals O
for O
10 O
days, O
and O
Rg1 O
(30 O
mg/kg) O
was O
intraperitoneally O
injected O
2 O
hours O
after O
the O
second O
injection O
of O
morphine O
once O
a O
day O
for O
10 O
days. O
Spatial O
learning O
capacity O
was O
assessed O
in O
the O
Morris O
water O
maze. O
The O
results O
showed O
that O
rats O
treated O
with O
Morphine/Rg1 O
decreased O
escape O
latency O
and O
increased O
the O
time O
spent O
in O
platform O
quadrant O
and O
entering O
frequency. O
By O
implantation O
of O
electrodes O
and O
electrophysiological O
recording O
in O
vivo, O
the O
results O
showed O
that O
Rg1 O
restored O
the O
long-term O
potentiation O
(LTP) O
impaired O
by O
morphine O
in O
both O
freely O
moving O
and O
anaesthetised O
rats. O
The O
electrophysiological O
recording O
in O
vitro O
showed O
that O
Rg1 O
restored O
the O
LTP O
in O
slices O
from O
the O
rats O
treated O
with O
morphine, O
but O
not O
changed O
LTP O
in O
the O
slices O
from O
normal O
saline- O
or O
morphine/Rg1-treated O
rats; O
this O
restoration O
could O
be O
inhibited O
by O
N-methyl-D-aspartate O
(NMDA) O
receptor O
antagonist O
MK801. O
We O
conclude O
that O
Rg1 O
may O
significantly O
improve O
the O
spatial O
learning O
capacity O
impaired O
by O
chonic O
morphine O
administration O
and O
restore O
the O
morphine-inhibited O
LTP. O
This O
effect O
is O
NMDA O
receptor O
dependent. O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
PURPOSE: O
The O
Intravenous O
Nimodipine O
West O
European O
Stroke B
Trial O
(INWEST) O
found O
a O
correlation O
between O
nimodipine-induced O
reduction B
in I
blood I
pressure I
(BP) O
and O
an O
unfavorable O
outcome O
in O
acute B
stroke. I
We O
sought O
to O
confirm O
this O
correlation O
with O
and O
without O
adjustment O
for O
prognostic O
variables O
and O
to O
investigate O
outcome O
in O
subgroups O
with O
increasing O
levels O
of O
BP B
reduction. I
METHODS: O
Patients O
with O
a O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
ischemic B
stroke I
(within O
24 O
hours) O
were O
consecutively O
allocated O
to O
receive O
placebo O
(n=100), O
1 O
mg/h O
(low-dose) O
nimodipine O
(n=101), O
or O
2 O
mg/h O
(high-dose) O
nimodipine O
(n=94). O
The O
correlation O
between O
average O
BP O
change O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
days O
and O
the O
outcome O
at O
day O
21 O
was O
analyzed. O
RESULTS: O
Two O
hundred O
sixty-five O
patients O
were O
included O
in O
this O
analysis O
(n=92, O
93, O
and O
80 O
for O
placebo, O
low O
dose, O
and O
high O
dose, O
respectively). O
Nimodipine O
treatment O
resulted O
in O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction B
in I
systolic I
BP I
(SBP) O
and O
diastolic O
BP O
(DBP) O
from O
baseline O
compared O
with O
placebo O
during O
the O
first O
few O
days. O
In O
multivariate O
analysis, O
a O
significant O
correlation O
between O
DBP B
reduction I
and O
worsening O
of O
the O
neurological O
score O
was O
found O
for O
the O
high-dose O
group O
(beta=0.49, O
P=0. O

Patients O
with O
a O
DBP O

There O
was O
no O

CONCLUSIONS: O
DBP, O
but O
not O
SBP, O
reduction O
was O
associated O
with O
neurological O
worsening O
after O
the O
intravenous O
administration O
of O
high-dose O
nimodipine O
after O
acute O
stroke. O
For O
low-dose O
nimodipine, O
the O
results O
were O
not O
conclusive. O
These O
results O
do O
not O
confirm O
or O
exclude O
a O
neuroprotective O
property O
of O
nimodipine. O

the O
Annuals O

Cases O
in O
Japan O
from O
1981 O

1985. O
The O
leading O

diseases I
(4.1%), O
cerebral B

(3.3%). O
Cerebral B

was O
the O
11th O
most O
frequent O
cause O
of O
death, O
accounting O
for O
only O
0.8% O

it O
was O
the O
5th O
most O

among O
the O
Japanese O
general O

The O
low O
incidence O
of O
cerebral O
haemorrhage O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
death O
in O
patients O
with O
Parkinson's O
disease O
may O
reflect O
the O
hypotensive B
effect O
of O
levodopa O
and O
a O
hypotensive O
mechanism O
due O
to O
reduced O
noradrenaline O

CNS O
toxic O
effects O

include O
a O
variety O
of O
neurological O
symptoms O
that O
can O
limit O
drug O
use. O
We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
a O
51-year-old O
man O
who O
developed O
severe, O
disabling O
negative O
myoclonus B
of O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
extremities O
after O
the O
infusion O
of O
ifosfamide O
for O
plasmacytoma. B
He O
was O
awake, O
revealed O
no O
changes O
of O
mental O
status O
and O
at O
rest O
there O
were O
no O
further O
motor O
symptoms. O
Cranial O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
and O
extensive O
laboratory O
studies O
failed O
to O
reveal O
structural B
lesions I
of I
the I
brain I
and O
metabolic B
abnormalities. I
An O
electroencephalogram O
showed O
continuous, O
generalized O
irregular O
slowing O
with O
admixed O
periodic O
triphasic O
waves O
indicating O
symptomatic O
encephalopathy. B
The O
administration O
of O
ifosfamide O
was O
discontinued O
and O
within O
12 O
h O
the O
asterixis B
resolved O
completely. O
In O
the O
patient O
described, O
the O
presence O
of O
asterixis O
during O

of O
ifosfamide, O
normal O

findings O
and O
imaging O
studies O
and O
the O
resolution O
of O
symptoms O
following O
the O
discontinuation O
of O
the O

suggest O
that O
negative O

In O
a O

we O
assessed O
the O
effect O
of O
"real" O
repetitive O
transcranial O

stimulation O
(rTMS) O
versus O
"sham" O
rTMS O
(placebo) O
on O
peak O
dose O
dyskinesias B
in O
patients O
with O
Parkinson's B
disease I
(PD). O
Ten B
patients O
with O
PD O
and O
prominent O
dyskinesias O
had O
rTMS O
(1,800 O
pulses; O
1 O
Hz O
rate) O
delivered O
over O
the O
motor O
cortex O
for O
4 O
consecutive O
days O
twice, O
once O
real O
stimuli O
and O
once O
sham O
stimulation O
were O
used; O
evaluations O
were O
done O
at O
the O
baseline O
and O
1 O
day O
after O
the O
end O
of O
each O
of O
the O
treatment O
series. O
Direct O
comparison O
between O
sham O
and O
real O
rTMS O
effects O
showed O
no O
significant O
difference O
in O
clinician-assessed O
dyskinesia O
severity. O
However, O
comparison O
with O
the O
baseline O
showed O
small O
but O
significant O
reduction O
in O
dyskinesia O
severity O
following O
real O
rTMS O
but O
not O
placebo. O
The O
major O
effect O
was O
on O
dystonia B
subscore. O
Similarly, O
in O
patient O
diaries, O
although O
both O
treatments O
caused O
reduction O
in O
subjective O
dyskinesia O
scores O
during O
the O
days O
of O
intervention, O
the O
effect O
was O
sustained O
for O
3 O
days O
after O
the O
intervention O
for O
the O
real O
rTMS O
only. O
Following O
rTMS, O
no O
side O
effects O
and O
no O
adverse O
effects O
on O
motor O
function O
and O
PD O
symptoms O
were O
noted. O
The O
results O
suggest O
the O
existence O
of O
residual O
beneficial O
clinical O
aftereffects O
of O
consecutive O
daily O
applications O
of O
low-frequency O
rTMS O
on O
dyskinesias O
in O

The O
effects O
may O
be O
further O
exploited O
for O
potential O
therapeutic O
uses. O

BACKGROUND: O
We O
clinically O
and O
pathologically O
analyzed O
renal O
allografts O
from O
1 O
9 O
renal O
transplant O
patients O
treated O
with O
tacrolimus O
(FK506) O
for O
more O
than O
1 O

METHODS: O
Twenty-six O
renal O
allograft O
biopsy O
specimens O
from O
1 O
9 O
renal O
transplant O
patients O
who O
underwent O
transplantations O
between O
1991 O
and O
1993 O
were O
evaluated. O
Thirteen O
biopsies O
were O
performed O
from O
stable O
functioning O
renal O
allografts O
with O
informed O
consent O
(nonepisode O
biopsy) O
and O
the O
other O
13 O
were O
from O
dysfunctional O
renal O
allografts O
with O
a O
clinical O
indication O
for O
biopsy O
(episode O
biopsy). O
RESULTS: O
The O
main O
pathologic O
diagnoses O
(some O
overlap) O
were O
acute O
rejection O
(AR; O
n O
= O
4), O
chronic O

(n O
= O
9), O
and O
mild-type O
FK506 O
nephropathy O
(n O

11). O
Of O
the O
nonepisode O
biopsies, O
7 O
and O
4 O
biopsies O
showed O
minimal-type O
and O
mild-type O
chronic O
FK506 O
nephropathy, O
respectively. O
Chronic O
FK506 O
nephropathy O
consisted O
of O
rough O
and O
foamy O
tubular O
vacuolization O
(5 O
biopsies), O
arteriolopathy O
(angiodegeneration O
of O
the O
arteriolar O
wall; O
20 O

patients O
in O
the O

were O
statistically O
higher O
than O
those O
in O
the O
minimum-type O
chronic O
FK506-nephropathy O
group O
(P< O

CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
chronic O
FK506 O
nephropathy O
consists O
primarily O
of O
arteriolopathy O
manifesting O
as O
insudative O
hyalinosis O
of O
the O
arteriolar O
wall, O
and O
suggests O
that O
mild-type O
chronic O
FK506 O
nephropathy O
is O
a O
condition O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
deterioration O
of O
renal O
allograft O
function. O

An O
80-yr-old O
man O
developed O
acute O
hepatitis B
shortly O
after O
ingesting O
oral O
ceftriaxone. O
Although O
the O
transaminases O
gradually O
returned O
to O
baseline O
after O
withholding O
the O
beta O
lactam O
antibiotic, O
there O
was O
a O
gradual O
increase O
in O
serum O
bilirubin O
and O
a O
decrease O
in O
hemoglobin O

caused O
by O
an O
autoimmune B
hemolytic I

and O
erythroblastocytopenia. B
These O
responded O
to O
systemic O
steroids O
and O
immunoglobulins. O
Despite O
the O
widespread O
use O
of O
these O
agents O
this O
triad O
of O

has O
not O
previously O
been O

in O
eight O
of O
160 O
patients O
treated O
with O
terbutaline O
for O
preterm B
labor. I
Associated O
corticosteroid O
therapy O
and O
twin O
gestations O
appear O
to O
be O
predisposing O
factors. O
Potential O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
pathophysiology O
are O
briefly O
discussed. O

Hepatocyte O
tight O
junctions O
(TJs), O
the O
only O
intercellular O
barrier O
between O
the O
sinusoidal O
and O
the O
canalicular O
spaces, O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
bile O
formation. O
Although O
hepatocyte O
TJs O
are O
impaired O
in O
cholestasis, B
attempts O
to O
localize O
the O
precise O
site O
of O
hepatocyte O
TJ O
damage O
by O
freeze-fracture O
electron O
microscopy O
have O
produced O
limited O
information. O
Recently, O
several O
TJ-associated O
proteins O
like O
ZO-1 O
and O
7H6 O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
characterized. O
Immunolocalization O
of O
7H6 O
appears O
to O
closely O
correlate O
with O
paracellular O
permeability. O
We O
used O
rat O
models O
of O
intrahepatic B
cholestasis I
by O
ethinyl O
estradiol O
(EE) O
treatment O
and O
extrahepatic B
cholestasis I
by O
bile O
duct O
ligation O
(BDL) O
to O
precisely O
determine O
the O
site O
of O
TJ O
damage. O
Alterations O
in O
hepatocyte O
TJs O
were O
assessed O
by O
double-immunolabeling O
for O
7H6 O
and O
ZO-1 O
using O
a O
confocal O
laser O
scanning O
microscope. O
In O
control O
rats, O
immunostaining O
for O
7H6 O
and O
ZO-1 O
colocalized O
to O
outline O
bile O
canaliculi O
in O
a O
continuous O
fashion. O
In O
contrast, O
7H6 O
and O
ZO-1 O
immunostaining O
was O
more O
discontinuous, O
outlining O
the O
bile O
canaliculi O
after O
BDL. O
Immunostaining O
for O
7H6, O
not O
ZO-1, O
decreased O
and O
predominantly O
appeared O
as O
discrete O
signals O
in O
the O
submembranous O
cytoplasm O
of O
periportal O
hepatocytes O
after O
BDL. O
After O
EE O
treatment, O
changes O
in O
immunostaining O
for O
7H6 O
and O
ZO-1 O
were O
similar O
to O
those O
seen O
in O
periportal O
hepatocytes O
after O
BDL, O
but O
distributed O
more O
diffusely O
throughout O
the O
lobule. O
This O
study O
is O
the O
first O
to O
demonstrate O
that O
impairment O
of O
hepatocyte O
TJs O
occurs O
heterogenously O
in O
the O
liver O
lobule O
after O
BDL O
and O
suggests O
that O
BDL O
and O
EE O
treatments O
produce O
different O
lobular O
distributions O
of O
increased O
paracellular O
permeability. O

BACKGROUND: O

were O
studied O
for O
the O
evaluation O
of O
short-term O

of O
raloxifene O
administration O
in O
postmenopausal O

METHODS: O
Thirty-nine O
postmenopausal O
women O
with O
osteopenia B
or O
osteoporosis B
were O
included O
in O
this O
prospective, O
controlled O
clinical O
study. O
Twenty-five O
women O
were O
given O
raloxifene O
hydrochloride O
(60 O
mg/day) O
plus O
calcium O
(500 O
mg/day). O
Age-matched O
controls O
(n O

14) O
were O
given O
only O
calcium. O
Plasma O
TAFI, O
tPA, O
and O
PAI-1 O
antigen O
levels O
were O
measured O
at O
baseline O
and O
after O
3 O
months O
of O
treatment O
by O
commercially O
available O
ELISA O
kits. O
Variations O
of O
individuals O
were O
assessed O
by O
Wilcoxon's O
test. O
Relationship O
between O
those O
markers O
and O
demographic O
characteristics O
were O
investigated. O
RESULTS: O
Three O
months O
of O
raloxifene O
treatment O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
the O
plasma O
TAFI O
antigen O
concentrations O
(16% O
change, O
P O
< O
0.01), O
and O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
tPA O
antigen O
concentrations O
(25% O
change, O
P O
< O
0.05). O
A O
significant O
correlation O
was O
found O
between O

concentrations O
and O
the O
duration O
of O
amenorrhea B
(P O

0.33). O
CONCLUSION: O
We O
suggest O
that O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
venous B
thromboembolism I
due O
to O
raloxifene O
treatment O
may O
be O
related O
to O

not O
TAFI O
levels. O

CASE O
SUMMARY: O
A O
25-year-old O
male O
patient, O
with O
a O
height O
of O
175 O
cm O
and O
weight O
of O
72 O
kg O
presented O
to O
Marmara O
University O
Hospital O
Emergency O
Department, O
Istanbul, O
Turkey, O
with O
5 O
days' O
history O
of O
jaundice, B
malaise, O
nausea, B
and O
vomiting. B
He O
had O
been O
prescribed O
telithromycin O
400 O
mg/d O
PO O
to O
treat O
an O
upper B
respiratory I
tract I
infection I
7 O
days O
prior. O
Admission O
laboratory O
tests O
were O
as O
follows: O
alanine O
aminotransferase, O
67 O
U/L O
(reference O
range, O
10-37 O
U/L); O
aspartate O
aminotransferase, O
98 O
U/L O
(10-40 O
U/L); O
alkaline O
phosphatase, O
513 O
U/L O
(0-270 O
U/L); O
gamma-glutamyltransferase, O
32 O
U/L O
(7-49 O
U/L); O
amylase, O
46 O
U/L O
(0-220 O
U/L); O
total O
bilirubin, O
20.1 O
mg/dL O
(0.2-1.0 O
mg/dL); O
direct O
bilirubin, O
14.8 O
mg/dL O
(0-0.3 O
mg/dL); O
and O
albumin, O
4.7 O
mg/dL O
(3.5-5.4 O
mg/dL). O
No O
toxin, O
alcohol, O
or O
other O
drugs O
were O
reported. O
The O
patient O
had O
suffered O
a O
previous O
episode O
of O
"acute O
hepatitis B
of O
unknown O
origin," O
that O
occurred O
after O
telithromycin O
usage. O
Both O
incidents O
occurred O
within O
a O
year. O
DISCUSSION: O
Telithromycin O
is O
the O
first O
of O
the O
ketolide O
antibacterials O
to O
receive O
US O
Food O
and O
Drug O
Administration O
approval O
for O
clinical O
use. O
It O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
infrequent O
and O
usually O
reversible O
severe O
hepatic B
dysfunction. I
Based O
on O
a O
score O
of O
8 O
on O
the O
Naranjo O
adverse O
drug O
reaction O
probability O
scale, O
telithromycin O
was O
the O
probable O
cause O
of O
acute O
hepatitis O
in O
this O
patient, O
and O
pathological O
findings O
suggested O
drug-induced O
toxic B
hepatitis. I
Recurrence O
of O
hepatitis O
attack O
might O
have O
been O
avoided O
if O
the O
initial O
incident O
had O
been O
communicated O
to O
the O
attending O
physician O
who O
prescribed O
telithromycin O
the O
second O
time. O
CONCLUSION: O
Here O
we O
report O
a O
case O
of O
acute O
hepatitis O
probably O
associated O
with O
the O
administration O
of O
telithromycin. O

The O
aggravated O
risk O
on O
intracerebral B
hemorrhage I
(ICH) O
with B
drugs O
used O
for O
stroke B
patients O
should O
be O
estimated O
carefully. O
We O
therefore O
established O
sensitive O
quantification O
methods O
and O
provided O
a O
rat O
ICH O
model O
for O
detection O
of O
ICH O
deterioration. O
In O
ICH O
intrastriatally O
induced O
by O
0.014-unit, O
0.070-unit, O
and O
0.350-unit O
collagenase, O
the O
amount O
of O
bleeding B
was O
measured O
using O
a O
hemoglobin O
assay O
developed O
in O
the O
present O
study O
and O
was O
compared O
with O
the O
morphologically O
determined O
hematoma B
volume. O
The O
blood O
amounts O
and O
hematoma O
volumes O
were O
significantly O
correlated, O
and O
the O
hematoma O
induced O
by O
0.014-unit O
collagenase O
was O
adequate O
to O
detect O
ICH O
deterioration. O
In O
ICH O
induction O
using O
0.014-unit O
collagenase, O
heparin O
enhanced O
the O
hematoma O
volume O
3.4-fold O
over O
that O
seen O
in O
control O
ICH O
animals O
and O
the O
bleeding O
7.6-fold. O
Data O
suggest O
that O
this O
sensitive O
hemoglobin O
assay O
is O
useful O
for O
ICH O
detection, O
and O
that O
a O
model O
with O
a O
small O
ICH O
induced O
with O
a O
low-dose O
collagenase O
should O
be O
used O
for O
evaluation O
of O
drugs O
that O
may O
affect O
ICH. O

Abstract O
Serum O

a O
commonly O
known O
adverse O

However, O
hepatotoxic B
events O
have O
not O
been O
widely O
published O
with O
ezetimibe O
or O
the O
combination O
agent O
simvastatin-ezetimibe. O
We O
describe O
a O
70-year-old O
Hispanic O
woman O
who O
developed O
fulminant B
hepatic I

10 O
weeks O
after O

from O

40 O
mg/day O
to O

40 O
mg/day. O
The O
patient's O
lipid O
panel O
had O
been O
maintained O
with O
simvastatin O
for O
18 O
months O
before O
the O
conversion O
without O
evidence O
of O
hepatotoxicity. B
A O
routine O
laboratory O
work-up O
10 O
weeks O
after O
conversion O
revealed O
elevated O
serum O
aminotransferase O
levels. O
Simvastatinezetimibe O
and O
escitalopram O
(which O
she O
was O
taking O
for O
depression) B
were O
discontinued, O
and O
other O
potential O
causes O
of O
hepatotoxicity O
were O
excluded. O
A O
repeat O
work-up O
revealed O
further O
elevations O
in O
aminotransferase O
levels, O
and O
liver O
biopsy O
revealed O
evidence O
of O
moderate-to-severe O
drug B
toxicity. I
She O
underwent O
liver O
transplantation O
with O
an O
uneventful O
postoperative O
course. O
Her O
aminotransferase O
levels O
returned O
to O
normal O
by O
postoperative O
day O
23, O
and O
her O
2-year O
follow-up O
showed O
no O
adverse O
events. O
Ezetimibe O
undergoes O
extensive O
glucuronidation O
by O
uridine O
diphosphate O
glucoronosyltransferases O
(UGT) O
in O
the O
intestine O
and O
liver O
and O
may O
have O
inhibited O
the O
glucuronidation O
of O
simvastatin O
hydroxy O
acid, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
simvastatin O
exposure O
and O
subsequent O
hepatotoxicity. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
case O
report O
of O
simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced O
liver B
failure I
that O
resulted O
in O
liver O
transplantation. O
We O
postulate O
that O
the O
mechanism O
of O
the O
simvastatinezetimibe-induced O
hepatotoxicity O
is O
the O
increased O
simvastatin O
exposure O
by O
ezetimibe O
inhibition O
of O
UGT O
enzymes. O
Clinicians O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
potential O
hepatotoxicity O
with O
simvastatin-ezetimibe O
especially O
in O
elderly O
patients O
and O
should O
carefully O
monitor O
serum O
aminotransferase O
levels O
when O
starting O
therapy O
and O
titrating O
the O
dosage. O

DISCUSSION: O
The O
risk O
of O
rhabdomyolysis O
is O
increased O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
concomitant O
drugs O
that O
inhibit O
simvastatin O
metabolism. O
Simvastatin O
is O
metabolized O
by O
CYP3A4. O
Amiodarone O
and O
atazanavir O
are O
recognized O
CYP3A4 O
inhibitors. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Pharmacokinetic O
differences O
in O
statins O
are O
an O
important O
consideration O
for O
assessing O
the O
risk O
of O
potential O
drug O
interactions. O
In O
patients O
requiring O
the O
concurrent O
use O
of O
statins O
and O
CYP3A4 O
inhibitors, O
pravastatin, O
fluvastatin, O
and O
rosuvastatin O
carry O
the O
lowest O
risk O
of O
drug O
interactions; O
atorvastatin O
carries O
moderate O
risk, O
whereas O
simvastatin O
and O
lovastatin O
have O
the O
highest O
risk O
and O
should O
be O
avoided O
in O
patients O
taking O
concomitant O

We O
examined O
the O
role O

the O
beta4 O

in O
nicotine-induced O

and O
hypolocomotion B
in O
beta4 O
homozygous O
null O
(beta4 O

mice. O
beta4 O
-/- O
mice O
were O
less O
sensitive O
to O
the O
effects O
of O
nicotine O
both O
at O
low O
doses, O
measured O
as O
decreased O
exploration O
in O
an O

and O
at O

Using O
in O

hybridization O
probes O
for O
the O
alpha3 O
and O

subunits, O
we O
showed O
that O
alpha5 O

unchanged, O
whereas O
alpha3 O
mRNA O
levels O
are O
selectively O
decreased O
in O

mRNA O
levels O
for O
the O
alpha5 O
and O
the O
beta4 O

were O
unchanged O
in O
alpha3 O

Together, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
beta4 O

Two O

There O
was O
no O
serologic O

and O
have O
remained O
well O
for O
a O
follow-up O
period O

We O
describe O
a O

The O
study O
investigates O
if O
alpha-lipoic O

is O
neuroprotective O
against O

neurotoxicity, B
if O
mitochondrial B
damage I
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
toxic B
neurodegenerative I
cascade, I
and O
if O
neuroprotective O
effects O
of O
alpha-lipoic O
acid O
depend O
on O
mitochondria O
protection. O
We O
used O
an O
in O

model O
of O
chemotherapy O
induced O
peripheral B
neuropathy I
that O
closely O
mimic O
the O
in O

condition O
by O
exposing O
primary O
cultures O
of O
dorsal O
root O
ganglion O
(DRG) O
sensory O
neurons O
to O
paclitaxel O
and O
cisplatin, O
two O
widely O
used O
and O
highly O
effective O
chemotherapeutic O
drugs. O
This O
approach O
allowed O
investigating O
the O
efficacy O
of O
alpha-lipoic O
acid O
in O
preventing O
axonal B
damage I
and O
apoptosis O
and O
the O
function O
and O
ultrastructural O
morphology O
of O
mitochondria O
after O
exposure O
to O
toxic O
agents O
and O
alpha-lipoic O
acid. O
Our O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
both O
cisplatin O
and O
paclitaxel O
cause O
early O
mitochondrial B
impairment I
with O
loss O
of O
membrane O
potential O
and O
induction O
of O
autophagic O
vacuoles O
in O
neurons. O
Alpha-lipoic O
acid O
exerts O
neuroprotective O
effects O
against O
chemotherapy O
induced O
neurotoxicity O
in O
sensory O
neurons: O
it O
rescues O
the O
mitochondrial B
toxicity I
and O
induces O
the O
expression O
of O
frataxin, O
an O
essential O
mitochondrial O
protein O
with O
anti-oxidant O
and O
chaperone O
properties. O
In O
conclusion O
mitochondrial O
toxicity O
is O
an O
early O
common O
event O
both O
in O
paclitaxel O
and O
cisplatin O
induced O
neurotoxicity. O
Alpha-lipoic O
acid O
protects O
sensory O
neurons O
through O
its O
anti-oxidant O
and O
mitochondrial O
regulatory O
functions, O
possibly O
inducing O
the O
expression O
of O
frataxin. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
alpha-lipoic O
acid O
might O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
peripheral B
nerve I
toxicity I
in O
patients O
undergoing O
chemotherapy O
and O
encourage O
further O
confirmatory O
clinical O
trials. O

Secondary I

Abnormal O
brain O

have O
been O
found O
in O
patients O
with O
hyperalgesia O
as O
well O
as O
in O
normal O
subjects O
during O
experimental O
central O
sensitization. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
assess O
the O
effects O
of O
gabapentin, O
a O
drug O
effective O
in O
neuropathic O
pain O
patients, O
on O
brain O
processing O
of O
nociceptive O
information O
in O
normal O
and O
central O
sensitization O
states. O
Using O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
(fMRI) O
in O
normal O
volunteers, O
we O
studied O
the O
gabapentin-induced O
modulation O
of O
brain O
activity O
in O
response O
to O
nociceptive O
mechanical O
stimulation O
of O
normal O
skin O
and O
capsaicin-induced O
secondary O
hyperalgesia. O
The O
dose O
of O
gabapentin O
was O
1,800 O
mg O
per O
os, O
in O
a O
single O
administration. O
We O
found O
that O
(i) O
gabapentin O
reduced O
the O
activations O
in O
the O
bilateral O
operculoinsular O
cortex, O
independently O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
central O
sensitization; O
(ii) O
gabapentin O
reduced O
the O
activation O
in O
the O
brainstem, O
only O
during O
central O
sensitization; O
(iii) O
gabapentin O
suppressed O
stimulus-induced O
deactivations, O
only O
during O
central O
sensitization; O
this O
effect O
was O
more O
robust O
than O
the O
effect O
on O
brain O
activation. O
The O
observed O
drug-induced O
effects O
were O
not O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
baseline O
fMRI O
signal. O
These O
findings O
indicate O
that O
gabapentin O
has O
a O
measurable O
antinociceptive O
effect O
and O
a O
stronger O
antihyperalgesic O
effect O
most O
evident O
in O
the O
brain O
areas O
undergoing O
deactivation, O
thus O
supporting O
the O
concept O
that O
gabapentin O
is O
more O
effective O
in O
modulating O
nociceptive O
transmission O
when O
central O
sensitization O
is O
present. O

was O
evaluated O
between O
January O
1992 O
and O
January O
1996. O
Two O
groups O
of O
patients O
receiving O
tacrolimus O
were O
compared O
over O
a O
period O
of O
1 O
year, O
one O
group O
comprising O
hypertensive B
patients O
who O
were O
receiving O
nifedipine, O
and O
the O
other O
comprising O
nonhypertensive O
patients O
not O
receiving O
nifedipine. O
The O
time O
from O
transplant O
to O
baseline O
was O
similar O
in O
all O
patients. O
Nifedipine O
significantly O
improved O
kidney O

as O
indicated O
by O
a O
significant O
lowering O
of O
serum O

at O
6 O
and O
12 O
months. O
The O
observed O

impact O
of O
nifedipine O
on O
reducing O
the O
nephrotoxicity B
associated O
with O
tacrolimus O
in O

should O
be O
an O

At O
the O

PG-9 O
did O
not O
produce O
any O

symptoms O
as O
revealed O
by O
the O

and O
it O
did O
not O
modify O
spontaneous O

as O
revealed O
by O
the O

PG-9 O
was O
also O
able O
to O
increase O
the O
amount O
of O
NGF O
secreted O
in O

by O
astrocytes O
in O
a O

manner. O
The O
maximal O
NGF O
contents O
obtained O
by O
PG-9 O
were O
17.6-fold O
of O
the O

value. O
During O
culture, O
no O
morphological O

were O
found O
at O
effective O

The O
current O
work O
indicates O
the O
ability O
of O
PG-9 O
to O
induce O
beneficial O
effects O
on O
cognitive O
processes O
and O
stimulate O

Therefore, O
PG-9 O
could O
represent O
a O
potential O

improve O
the O

6-35 O
years O
(mean O
17,2 O

were O
on O
a O
regular O
transfusion-chelation O
program O
maintaining O
a O
mean O
hemoglobin O

RESULTS: O
Overall, O
21 O
out O

104 O
patients O
(20.2%) O
presented O
with O
high O

Patients O
with O
SNHL O
presented O
with O
relatively O
lower O
serum O

than O
those O
with O
normal O
hearing, O
however, O
no O

observed. O
Subjects O
with O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
findings O
are O
indicative O
of O
DFO's O
contributing O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O

may O
be O
judiciously O
adjusted O
in O

Because O
of O
the O

we O
concluded O
that O

cannot O
be O
used O
practically O
to O

The O

When O

In O
conclusion, O
CPA, O

prevented O
the O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
examine O
the O
role O

receptor O
5 O
(mGluR5) O
in O
the O
toxic O
action O
of O
methamphetamine O
on O
dopaminergic O
neurones O
in O
rats. O
Methamphetamine O
(10 O
mg/kg O

administered O
five O
times, O
reduced O
the O
levels O
of O
dopamine O
and O
its O
metabolites O
in O

tissue O
when O
measured O
72 O

A O
selective O
antagonist O
of O
mGluR5, O
2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine O
(MPEP; O
5 O
mg/kg O
ip), O
when O
administered O
five O
times O
immediately O
before O
each O
methamphetamine O
injection O
reversed O
the O
above-mentioned O
methamphetamine O
effects. O
A O
single O
MPEP O
(5 O
mg/kg O

injection O
reduced O
the O
basal O
extracellular O
dopamine O
level O
in O
the O
striatum, O
as O
well O
as O
dopamine O

stimulated O
either O
by O
methamphetamine O
(10 O
mg/kg O

or O
by O
intrastriatally O
administered O
veratridine O
(100 O
microM). O
Moreover, O
it O
transiently O
diminished O
the O
methamphetamine O
(10 O
mg/kg O
sc)-induced O
hyperthermia B
and O
reduced O
basal O
body O
temperature. O
MPEP O
administered O
into O
the O
striatum O
at O
high O
concentrations O
(500 O
microM) O
increased O
extracellular O
dopamine O
levels, O
while O
lower O
concentrations O
(50-100 O
microM) O
were O
devoid O
of O
any O
effect. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
study O
suggest O
that O
the O
blockade O
of O
mGluR5 O
by O
MPEP O
may O
protect O
dopaminergic O
neurones O
against O
methamphetamine-induced O
toxicity. B
Neuroprotection O
rendered O
by O
MPEP O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O
methamphetamine-induced O
dopamine O
efflux O
in O
the O
striatum O
due O
to O
the O
blockade O
of O
extrastriatal O
mGluR5, O

with O
a O
decrease O
in O

BACKGROUND: O
Cardiac O
troponins O
I O
(cTnI) O
and O
T O
(cTnT) O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
highly O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
markers O
of O
myocardial B

We O
investigated O
the O
diagnostic O
value O
of O
cTnI O
and O
cTnT O
for O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
myocardial B
damage I
in O
a O
rat O
model O
of O
doxorubicin O
(DOX)-induced O
cardiomyopathy, B
and O
we O
examined O
the O
relationship O
between O
serial O
cTnI O
and O
cTnT O
with O
the O
development O
of O
cardiac B
disorders I
monitored O
by O
echocardiography O
and O
histological O
examinations O
in O
this O
model. O
METHODS: O
Thirty-five O
Wistar O
rats O
were O
given O
1.5 O
mg/kg O
DOX, O
i.v., O
weekly O
for O
up O
to O
8 O
weeks O
for O
a O
total O
cumulative O
dose O
of O
12 O
mg/kg O
BW. O
Ten O
rats O
received O
saline O
as O
a O
control O
group. O
cTnI O
was O
measured O
with O
Access(R) O
(ng/ml) O
and O
a O
research O
immunoassay O
(pg/ml), O
and O
compared O
with O
cTnT, O
CK-MB O
mass O
and O
CK. O
By O
using O
transthoracic O
echocardiography, O
anterior O
and O
posterior O
wall O
thickness, O
LV O
diameters O
and O
LV O
fractional O
shortening O
(FS) O
were O
measured O
in O
all O

before O
DOX O
or O
saline, O
and O
at O
weeks O
6 O
and O
9 O
after O
treatment O
in O
all O
surviving O
rats. O
Histology O
was O
performed O
in O
DOX-rats O
at O
6 O
and O
9 O
weeks O
after O
the O
last O
DOX O
dose O
and O
in O
all O
controls. O
RESULTS: O
Eighteen O
of O
the O
DOX O
rats O
died O
prematurely O
of O
general O
toxicity B
during O
the O
9-week O
period. O
End-diastolic O
(ED) O
and O
end-systolic O
(ES) O
LV O
diameters/BW O
significantly O
increased, O
whereas O
LV O
FS O
was O
decreased O
after O
9 O
weeks O
in O
the O
DOX O
group O
(p<0.001). O
These O
parameters O
remained O
unchanged O
in O
controls. O
Histological O
evaluation O
of O
hearts O
from O
all O
rats O
given O
DOX O
revealed O
significant O
slight O
degrees O
of O
perivascular O
and O
interstitial O
fibrosis. B
In O
7 O
of O
the O
18 O
rats, O
degeneration O
and O
myocyte O
vacuolisation O
were O
found. O
Only O
five O
of O
the O
controls O
exhibited O
evidence O
of O
very O
slight O
perivascular O
fibrosis. O
A O
significant O
rise O
in O
cTnT O
was O
found O
in O
DOX O
rats O
after O
cumulative O
doses O
of O
7.5 O
and O
12 O
mg/kg O
in O
comparison O
with O
baseline O
(p<0.05). O
cTnT O
found O
in O
rats O
after O
12 O
mg/kg O
were O
significantly O
greater O
than O
that O
found O
after O
7.5 O
mg/kg O
DOX. O
Maximal O
cTnI O
(pg/ml) O
and O
cTnT O
levels O
were O
significantly O
increased O
in O
DOX O
rats O
compared O
with O
controls O
(p=0.006, O
0.007). O
cTnI O
(ng/ml), O
CK-MB O
mass O
and O
CK O
remained O
unchanged O
in O
DOX O
rats O
compared O
with O
controls. O
All O
markers O
remained O
stable O
in O
controls. O
Analysis O
of O
data O
revealed O
a O
significant O
correlation O
between O
maximal O
cTnT O
and O
ED O
and O
ES O
LV O
diameters/BW O
(r=0.81 O
and O
0.65; O
p<0.0001). O
A O
significant O
relationship O
was O
observed O
between O
maximal O
cTnT O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
myocardial O
morphological O
changes, O
and O
between O
LV O
diameters/BW O
and O
histological O
findings. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Among O
markers O
of O
ischemic B
injury I
after O
DOX O
in O
rats, O
cTnT O
showed O
the O
greatest O
ability O
to O
detect O
myocardial O
damage O
assessed O
by O
echocardiographic O
detection O
and O
histological O
changes. O
Although O
there O
was O
a O
discrepancy O
between O
the O
amount O
of O
cTnI O
and O
cTnT O
after O
DOX, O
probably O
due O
to O
heterogeneity O
in O
cross-reactivities O
of O
mAbs O
to O
various O
cTnI O
and O
cTnT O
forms, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
cTnT O
in O
rats O
after O
DOX O
indicates O
cell O
damage O
determined O
by O
the O
magnitude O
of O
injury O
induced O
and O
that O
cTnT O
should O
be O
a O
useful O
marker O
for O
the O
prediction O
of O
experimentally O
induced O
cardiotoxicity B
and O
possibly O
for O
cardioprotective O
experiments. O

To O
test O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
hypomethylation O
of O
DNA O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
initiation B
of I
carcinogenic I
process, I
5-azacytidine O
(5-AzC) O
(10 O
mg/kg), O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
DNA O
methylation, O
was O
given O
to O
rats O
during O
the O
phase O
of O
repair O
synthesis O
induced O
by O
the O
three O
carcinogens, O
benzo[a]-pyrene O
(200 O
mg/kg), O
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea O
(60 O
mg/kg) O
and O
1,2-dimethylhydrazine O
(1,2-DMH) O
(100 O
mg/kg). O
The O
initiated O
hepatocytes O
in O
the O
liver O
were O
assayed O
as O
the O
gamma-glutamyltransferase O
(gamma-GT) O
positive O
foci O
formed O
following O
a O
2-week O
selection O
regimen O
consisting O
of O
dietary O
0.02% O
2-acetylaminofluorene O
coupled O
with O
a O
necrogenic O
dose O
of O
CCl4. O
The O
results O
obtained O
indicate O
that O
with O
all O
three O
carcinogens, O
administration O
of O
5-AzC O
during O
repair O
synthesis O
increased O
the O
incidence O
of O
initiated O
hepatocytes, O
for O
example O
10-20 O
foci/cm2 O
in O
5-AzC O
and O
carcinogen-treated O
rats O
compared O
with O
3-5 O
foci/cm2 O
in O
rats O
treated O
with O
carcinogen O
only. O
Administration O
of O
[3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine O
during O
the O
repair O
synthesis O
induced O
by O
1,2-DMH O
further O
showed O
that O
0.019 O
mol O
% O
of O
cytosine O
residues O
in O
DNA O
were O
substituted O
by O
the O
analogue, O
indicating O
that O
incorporation O
of O
5-AzC O
occurs O
during O
repair O
synthesis. O
In O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
carcinogen, O
5-AzC O
given O
after O
a O
two O
thirds O
partial O
hepatectomy, O
when O
its O
incorporation O
should O
be O
maximum, O
failed O
to O
induce O
any O
gamma-GT O
positive O
foci. O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
hypomethylation O
of O
DNA O
per O
se O
may O
not O
be O
sufficient O
for O
initiation. O
Perhaps O
two O
events O
might O
be O
necessary O
for O
initiation, O
the O
first O
caused O
by O
the O
carcinogen O
and O
a O
second O
involving O
hypomethylation O
of O
DNA. O

We O

the O
case O
of O
a O
70-year-old O
hypertensive B
man O
with O
a O
solitary O
kidney O
and O
chronic B
renal I
insufficiency I
who O
developed O
two O
episodes O
of O
transient O
anuria B
after O
losartan O
administration. O
He O
was O
hospitalized O
for O
a O
myocardial B
infarction I
with O
pulmonary B
edema, I
treated O
with O
high-dose O
diuretics. O
Due O
to O
severe O
systolic B
dysfunction I
losartan O
was O
prescribed. O
Surprisingly, O
the O
first O
dose O
of O
50 O
mg O
of O
losartan O
resulted O
in O
a O
sudden O
anuria, O
which O
lasted O
eight O
hours O
despite O
high-dose O
furosemide O
and O
amine O
infusion. O
One O
week O
later, O
by O
mistake, O
losartan O
was O
prescribed O
again O
and O
after O
the O
second O
dose O
of O
50 O
mg, O
the O
patient O
developed O
a O
second O
episode O
of O
transient O
anuria O
lasting O
10 O
hours. O
During O
these O
two O
episodes, O
his O
blood O
pressure O
diminished O
but O
no O
severe O
hypotension B
was O
noted. O
Ultimately, O
an O
arteriography O
showed O
a O
70-80% O
renal B
artery I
stenosis. I
In O
this O
patient, O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
combined O
with O
heart B
failure I
and O
diuretic O
therapy O
certainly O
resulted O
in O
a O
strong O
activation O
of O
the O
renin-angiotensin O
system O
(RAS). O
Under O
such O
conditions, O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
blockade O
by O
losartan O
probably O
induced O
a O
critical O
fall O
in O
glomerular O

pressure. O
This O
case O

the O
fact O
that O
the O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonist O
losartan O
can O
cause O
serious O
unexpected O
complications O
in O
patients O

patients O
with O

who O
were O
receiving O
iron O

Twenty-two O
patients O
in O
the O

group O
had O
abnormal B
audiograms I
with I

mostly I
in I
the I
high I

and O
in O
the O
hearing O

levels O
of O
30 O

100 O
decibels. O
When O
deferoxamine O
therapy O
was O
discontinued O
and O
serial O
studies O
were O
performed, O
audiograms O
in O
seven O
cases O
reverted O
to O
normal O
or O
near O
normal O
within O
two O
to O
three O
weeks, O
and O
nine O
of O
13 O
patients O
with O
symptoms O
became O
asymptomatic. O
Audiograms O
from O
15 O
patients O
remained O
abnormal O
and O
four O
patients O
required O
hearing O
aids O
because O
of O
permanent B
disability. I
Since O
18 O
of O
the O
22 O
patients O
were O
initially O
receiving O
deferoxamine O
doses O
in O
excess O
of O
the O
commonly O
recommended O
50 O
mg/kg O
per O
dose, O
therapy O
was O
restarted O
with O
lower O
doses, O
usually O
50 O
mg/kg O
per O
dose O
or O
less O
depending O
on O
the O
degree O
of O
auditory B
abnormality, I
and O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
two O
cases O
no O
further O

demonstrated. O
Auditory O
deterioration O
and O
improvement, O
demonstrated O
serially O
in O
individual O
patients O
receiving O
and O
not O
receiving O
deferoxamine, O
respectively, O
provided O
convincing O
evidence O
for O
a O
cause-and-effect O
relation O
between O
deferoxamine O
administration O
and O
ototoxicity. B
Based O
on O
these O
data, O
a O
plan O
of O
management O
was O
developed O
that O
allows O
effective O
yet O
safe O
administration O
of O
deferoxamine. O
A O
dose O
of O
50 O
mg/kg O
is O
recommended O
in O
those O
without O
audiogram O
abnormalities. O
With O
mild O
toxicity, O
a O
reduction O
to O
30 O
or O
40 O
mg/kg O
per O
dose O
should O
result O
in O
a O
reversal O
of O
the O
abnormal O
results O
to O
normal O
within O
four O
weeks. O
Moderate O
abnormalities O
require O
a O
reduction O
of O
deferoxamine O
to O
25 O
mg/kg O
per O
dose O
with O
careful O
monitoring. O
In O
those O
with O
symptoms O
of O
hearing B
loss, I
the O
drug O
should O
be O
stopped O
for O
four O
weeks, O
and O
when O
the O
audiogram O
is O
stable O
or O
improved, O
therapy O
should O
be O
restarted O
at O
10 O
to O
25 O
mg/kg O
per O
dose. O
Serial O
audiograms O
should O
be O
performed O
every O
six O
months O
in O
those O
without O
problems O
and O
more O
frequently O
in O
young O
patients O
with O

to O
the O

revealed O
the O

be O
severely O
compressed O
by O
the O

Intracranial O
pressure O
(ICP) O
was O
measured O
during O
alfentanil-induced O
rigidity B
in O
rats. O
Ten O
rats O
had O
arterial, O
central O
venous O
(CVP), O
and O
subdural O
cannulae O
inserted O
under O
halothane O
anesthesia. O
The O
animals O
were O
mechanically O
ventilated O
to O
achieve O
normocarbia O
(PCO2 O
= O
42 O
+/- O
1 O
mmHg, O
mean O
+/- O

Following O
instrumentation, O
halothane O
was O
discontinued O
and O
alfentanil O
(125 O
mu/kg) O
administered O
iv O
during O

In O
the O
five O

ICP O

increased O
significantly O
above O

(delta O
ICP O
7.5 O
+/- O
1.0 O

delta O
CVP O
5.9 O
+/- O

These O
variables O
returned O
to O

when O

In O
five O
rats O
that O
did O
not O

did O
not O
change O
following O

These O
observations O
suggest O
that O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
septo-hippocampal O
cholinergic O
pathway O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
epileptogenesis, O
and O
genetic O
factors O
influence O
the O
response O
to O
cholinergic O
agents, O
but O
limited O
data O
are O
available O
on O
cholinergic O
involvement O
in O
alcohol O
withdrawal O
severity. O
Thus, O
the O
relationship O
between O
cholinergic O
activity O
and O
responsiveness O
and O
alcohol O
withdrawal O
was O
investigated O
in O
a O
genetic O
animal O
model O
of O
ethanol O
withdrawal O
severity. O
METHODS: O
Cholinergic O
convulsant O
sensitivity O
was O
examined O
in O
alcohol-na O
ve O
Withdrawal O
Seizure-Prone B
(WSP) O
and-Resistant O
(WSR) O
mice. O
Animals O
were O
administered O
nicotine, O
carbachol, O
or O
neostigmine O
via O
timed O
tail O
vein O
infusion, O
and O
the O
latencies O
to O
onset O
of O
tremor B
and O
clonus O
were O
recorded O
and O
converted O
to O
threshold O
dose. O
We O
also O
used O
microdialysis O
to O
measure O
basal O
and O
potassium-stimulated O
acetylcholine O
(ACh) O
release O
in O
the O
CA1 O
region O
of O
the O
hippocampus. O
Potassium O
was O
applied O
by O
reverse O
dialysis O
twice, O
separated O
by O
75 O
min. O
Hippocampal O
ACh O
also O
was O
measured O
during O
testing O
for O
handling-induced O
convulsions. B
RESULTS: O
Sensitivity O
to O
several O
convulsion O
endpoints O
induced O
by O
nicotine, O
carbachol, O
and O
neostigmine O
were O
significantly O
greater O
in O
WSR O
versus O
WSP O
mice. O
In O
microdialysis O
experiments, O
the O
lines O
did O
not O
differ O
in O
basal O
release O
of O
ACh, O
and O
50 O
mM O
KCl O
increased O
ACh O
output O
in O
both O
lines O
of O
mice. O
However, O
the O
increase O
in O
release O
of O
ACh O
produced O
by O
the O
first O
application O
of O
KCl O
was O
2-fold O
higher O
in O
WSP O
versus O
WSR O
mice. O
When O
hippocampal O
ACh O
was O
measured O
during O
testing O
for O
handling-induced O
convulsions, O
extracellular O
ACh O
was O
significantly O
elevated O
(192%) O
in O
WSP O
mice, O
but O
was O
nonsignificantly O
elevated O
(59%) O
in O
WSR O
mice. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
differences O
in O
cholinergic O
activity O
and O
postsynaptic O
sensitivity O
to O
cholinergic O
convulsants B
may O
be O
associated O
with O
ethanol O
withdrawal O
severity O
and O
implicate O
cholinergic O
mechanisms O
in O
alcohol O
withdrawal. O
Specifically, O
WSP O
mice O
may O
have O
lower O
sensitivity O
to O
cholinergic O
convulsants O
compared O
with O
WSR O
because O
of O
postsynaptic O
receptor O
desensitization O
brought O
on O
by O
higher O
activity O
of O
cholinergic O
neurons. O

These O
studies O
were O
conducted O
to O
examine O
the O
differential O
response O
to O
a O
drug O
challenge O
under O
varied O
experimental O
test O
conditions O
routinely O
employed O
to O
study O
drug-induced O
behavioral O
and O
neurophysiological O
responses O
in O
rodents. O
Apomorphine, O
a O
nonselective O
dopamine O
agonist, O
was O
selected O
due O
to O
its O
biphasic O
behavioral O
effects, O
its O
ability O
to O
induce O
hypothermia, B
and O
to O
produce O
distinct O
changes O
to O
dopamine O
turnover O
in O
the O
rodent O
brain. O
From O
such O
experiments O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
characterization O
and O
detection O
of O
apomorphine-induced O
activity O
in O
rodents O
critically O
depends O
upon O
the O
test O
conditions O
employed. O
In O
rats, O
detection O
of O
apomorphine-induced O
hyperactivity B
was O
facilitated O
by O
a O
period O
of O
acclimatization O
to O
the O
test O
conditions. O
Moreover, O
test O
conditions O
can O
impact O
upon O
other O
physiological O
responses O
to O
apomorphine O
such O
as O
drug-induced O
hypothermia. O
In O
mice, O
apomorphine O
produced O
qualitatively O
different O
responses O
under O
novel O
conditions O
when O
compared O
to O
those O
behaviors O
elicited O
in O
the O
home O
test O
cage. O
Drug-induced O
gross O
activity O
counts O
were O
increased O
in O
the O
novel O
exploratory O
box O
only, O
while O
measures O
of O
stereotypic O
behavior O
were O
similar O
in O
both. O
By O
contrast, O
apomorphine-induced O
locomotion O
was O
more O
prominent O
in O
the O
novel O
exploratory O
box. O
Dopamine O
turnover O
ratios O
(DOPAC:DA O
and O
HVA:DA) O
were O
found O
to O
be O
lower O
in O
those O
animals O
exposed O
to O
the O
exploratory O
box O
when O
compared O
to O
their O
home O
cage O
counterparts. O
However, O
apomorphine-induced O
reductions O
in O
striatal O
dopamine O
turnover O
were O
detected O
in O
both O
novel O
and O
home O
cage O
environments. O
The O
implications O
of O
these O
findings O
are O
discussed O
with O
particular O
emphasis O
upon O
conducting O
psychopharmacological O
challenge O
tests O
in O
rodents. O

that O

The O
goal O
of O
these O
studies O
was O
to O
use O
an O
animal O
model O
to O
examine O
the O
effects O
of O
prenatal O
protein O
deprivation O
on O
behaviors O
and O
receptor O

with O
relevance O
to O
schizophrenia. O
We O
report O
that O
prenatally O
protein O
deprived O
(PD) O
female O
rats O
showed O
an O
increased O
stereotypic O
response O
to O
apomorphine O
and O
an O
increased O
locomotor O
response O
to O
amphetamine O
in O
adulthood. O
These O
differences O
were O
not O
observed O
during O
puberty. O
No O
changes O
in O
haloperidol-induced O
catalepsy B
or O
MK-801-induced O
locomotion O
were O
seen O
following O
PD. O
In O
addition, O
PD O
female O
rats O
showed O
increased O
(3)H-MK-801 O
binding O
in O
the O
striatum O
and O
hippocampus, O
but O
not O
in O
the O
cortex. O
PD O
female O
rats O
also O
showed O
increased O
(3)H-haloperidol O
binding O
and O
decreased O
dopamine O
transporter O
binding O
in O
striatum. O
No O
statistically O
significant O
changes O
in O
behavior O
or O
receptor O
binding O
were O
found O
in O
PD O
males O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
increased O
(3)H-MK-801 O
binding O
in O
cortex. O
This O
animal O
model O
may O
be O
useful O
to O
explore O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
prenatal O
nutritional B
deficiency I
enhances O
risk O
for O
schizophrenia O
in O
humans O
and O
may O
also O
have O
implications O
for O
developmental O
processes O
leading O
to O
differential O

BACKGROUND: O
We O
report O
on O
the O
manifestation O
of O
a O
levetiracetam O
(LEV)-induced O
encephalopathy. B
FINDINGS: O
A O
28-year-old O
man O
suffering O
from O
idiopathic B
epilepsy I
with O
generalized O
seizures B
was O
treated O
with O
LEV O
(3000 O
mg) O
added O
to O
valproate O
(VPA) O
(2000 O
mg). O
Frequency O
of O
generalized O
tonic-clonic B
seizures I
increased O
from O
one O
per O
6 O
months O
to O
two O
per O
month. O
Neuropsychological O
testing O
showed O
impaired B
word I
fluency, I
psychomotor I
speed I
and I
working I
memory. I
The O
interictal O
electroencephalogram O
(EEG) O
showed O
a O
generalized O
slowing O
to O
5 O
per O
second O
theta O
rhythms O
with O
bilateral O
generalized O
high-amplitude O
discharges. O
OUTCOME: O
Following O
discontinuation O
of O
LEV, O
EEG O
and O
neuropsychological O
findings O
improved O
and O
seizure O
frequency O
decreased. O

The O
effect O
of O
a O
6-week O
treatment O
with O
the O
calcium O

nitrendipine O
or O
the O
angiotensin O

enalapril O
on O
blood O
pressure, O
albuminuria, B
renal O
hemodynamics, O
and O
morphology O
of O
the O
nonclipped O
kidney O
was O
studied O
in O
rats O
with O
two-kidney, O
one O
clip O
renovascular B
hypertension. I
Six O
weeks O
after O
clipping O
of O
one O
renal O
artery, O
hypertensive B
rats O
(178 O
+/- O
4 O
mm O
Hg) O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
three O
groups: O
untreated O
hypertensive O
controls O
(n O
= O
8), O
enalapril-treated O
(n O
= O
8), O
or O
nitrendipine-treated O
(n O
= O
10). O
Sham-operated O
rats O
served O
as O
normotensive O
controls O
(128 O
+/- O
3 O
mm O
Hg, O
n O
= O
8). O
After O
6 O
weeks O
of O
treatment, O
renal O
hemodynamics O
(glomerular O
filtration O
rate O
and O
renal O
plasma O
flow) O
were O
measured O
in O
the O
anesthetized O
rats. O
Renal O
tissue O
was O
obtained O
for O
determination O
of O
glomerular O
size O
and O
sclerosis. O
Enalapril O
but O
not O
nitrendipine O
reduced O
blood O
pressure O
significantly. O
After O
6 O
weeks O
of O
therapy, O
glomerular O
filtration O
rate O
was O
not O
different O
among O
the O
studied O
groups. O
Renal O
plasma O
flow O
increased, O
but O
albumin O
excretion O
and O
glomerulosclerosis B
did O
not O
change O
after O
enalapril O
treatment. O
In O
contrast, O
in O
the O
nitrendipine-treated O
group O
albuminuria O
increased O
from O
12.8 O
+/- O
2 O
progressively O
to O
163 O
+/- O
55 O
compared O
with O
19.2 O
+/- O
9 O
mg/24 O
hr O
in O
the O
hypertensive O
controls. O
Furthermore, O
glomerulosclerosis O
index O
was O
significantly O
increased O
in O
the O
nitrendipine-treated O
group O
compared O
with O
the O
hypertensive O
controls O
(0.38 O
+/- O
0.1 O
versus O
0.13 O
+/- O
0.04). O
In O
addition, O
glomerular O
size O
was O
higher O
in O
the O
nitrendipine-treated O
group O
(14.9 O
+/- O
0.17 O
10(-3) O
mm2) O
but O
lower O
in O
the O
enalapril-treated O
group O
(11.5 O
+/- O
0.15 O

compared O
with O
the O
hypertensive O
controls O

The O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
delineate O
brain O

Eight O

in O
13-60% O

Because O
knowledge O
of O
stone O
composition O
is O
essential O
for O
studies O
of O
their O
pathogenesis, O
treatment, O
and O

this O
was O

by O
direct O
and O
indirect O
methods O
in O
14 O
octreotide O

acromegalic B
patients O
with O
gall B
stones. I
Chemical O
analysis O
of O
gall O
stones O
retrieved O
at O
cholecystectomy O
from O
two O
patients, O
showed O
that O
they O
contained O
71% O
and O
87% O
cholesterol O
by O
weight. O
In O
the O
remaining O
12 O
patients, O
localised O
computed O
tomography O
of O
the O
gall O
bladder O
showed O
that O
eight O
had O
stones O
with O
maximum O
attenuation O
scores O
of O
< O
100 O
Hounsfield O
units O
(values O
of O
< O
100 O
HU O
predict O
cholesterol O

stones). O
Gall O
bladder O
bile O
was O
obtained O
by O
ultrasound O
guided, O
fine O
needle O
puncture O
from O
six O
patients. O
All O
six O
patients O
had O
supersaturated O
bile O
(mean O
(SEM) O
cholesterol O
saturation O
index O
of O
1.19 O
(0.08) O
(range O

and O
all O
had O
abnormally O
rapid O
cholesterol O
microcrystal O

(< O
4 O
days O
(range O
1-4)), O
whilst O
in O
four, O
the O
bile O
contained O
cholesterol O
microcrystals O
immediately O
after O
sampling. O
Of O
the O
12 O
patients O
considered O
for O
oral O
ursodeoxycholic O
acid O
(UDCA) O
treatment, O
two O
had O
a O
blocked O
cystic O
duct O
and O
were O
not O
started O
on O
UDCA O
while O
one O
was O
lost O
to O
follow O
up. O
After O
one O
year O
of O
treatment, O
five O
of O
the O
remaining O
nine O
patients O
showed O
either O
partial O
(n O
= O
3) O
or O
complete O
(n O
= O
2) O
gall O
stone O
dissolution, O
suggesting O
that O
their O
stones O
were O
cholesterol O
rich. O
This O
corresponds, O
by O
actuarial O
(life O
table) O
analysis, O
to O
a O
combined O
gall O
stone O
dissolution O
rate O
of O
58.3 O
(15.9%). O
In O
conclusion, O
octreotide O
induced O
gall O
stones O
are O
generally O
small, O
multiple, O
and O
cholesterol O
rich O
although, O
in O
common O
with O

disease, I
at O
presentation O
some O
patients O
will O
have O
a O

both O
had O

which O
were O
refractory O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
calcineurin O
inhibitors O
cyclosporine O
and O
tacrolimus O
are O
both O
known O
to O
be O
nephrotoxic. B
Their O
use O
in O
orthotopic O
liver O
transplantation O
(OLTX) O
has O
dramatically O
improved O
success O
rates. O
Recently, O
however, O
we O
have O
had O
an O
increase O
of O
patients O
who O
are O
presenting O
after O
OLTX O
with O
end-stage B
renal I
disease I
(ESRD). O
This B
retrospective O
study O
examines O
the O
incidence O
and O
treatment O
of O
ESRD O
and O
chronic B
renal I
failure I
(CRF) O
in B
OLTX O
patients. O
METHODS: O
Patients O
receiving O
an O
OLTX O
only O
from O
June O
1985 O
through O
December O
of O
1994 O
who O
survived O
6 O
months O
postoperatively O
were O
studied O
(n=834). O
Our O
prospectively O
collected O
database O
was O
the O
source O
of O
information. O
Patients O
were O
divided O
into O
three O
groups: O
Controls, O
no O
CRF O
or O
ESRD, O
n=748; O
CRF, O
sustained O
serum O
creatinine O
>2.5 O
mg/dl, O
n=41; O
and O
ESRD, O
n=45. O
Groups O
were O
compared O
for O
preoperative O
laboratory O
variables, O
diagnosis, O
postoperative O
variables, O
survival, O
type O
of O
ESRD O
therapy, O
and O
survival O
from O
onset O
of O
ESRD. O
RESULTS: O
At O
13 O
years O
after O
OLTX, O
the O
incidence O
of O
severe O
renal B
dysfunction I
was O
18.1% O
(CRF O
8.6% O
and O
ESRD O
9.5%). O
Compared O
with O
control O
patients, O
CRF O
and O
ESRD O
patients O
had O
higher O
preoperative O
serum O
creatinine O
levels, O
a O
greater O
percentage O
of O
patients O
with O
hepatorenal B
syndrome, I
higher O
percentage O
requirement O
for O
dialysis O
in O
the O
first O
3 O
months O
postoperatively, O
and O
a O
higher O
1-year O
serum O
creatinine. O
Multivariate O
stepwise O
logistic O
regression O
analysis O
using O
preoperative O
and O
postoperative O
variables O
identified O
that O
an O
increase O
of O
serum O
creatinine O
compared O
with O
average O
at O
1 O
year, O
3 O
months, O
and O
4 O
weeks O
postoperatively O
were O
independent O
risk O
factors O
for O
the O
development O
of O
CRF O
or O
ESRD O
with O
odds O
ratios O
of O
2.6, O
2.2, O
and O
1.6, O
respectively. O
Overall O
survival O
from O
the O
time O
of O
OLTX O
was O
not O
significantly O
different O
among O
groups, O
but O
by O
year O
13, O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
patients O
who O
had O
ESRD O
was O
only O
28.2% O
compared O
with O
54.6% O
in O
the O
control O
group. O
Patients O
developing O
ESRD O
had O
a O
6-year O
survival O
after O
onset O
of O
ESRD O
of O
27% O
for O
the O
patients O
receiving O
hemodialysis O
versus O
71.4% O
for O
the O
patients O
developing O
ESRD O
who O
subsequently O
received O
kidney O
transplants. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Patients O
who O
are O
more O
than O
10 O
years O
post-OLTX O
have O
CRF O
and O
ESRD O
at O
a O
high O
rate. O
The O
development O
of O
ESRD O
decreases O
survival, O
particularly O
in O
those O
patients O
treated O
with O
dialysis O
only. O
Patients O
who O
develop O
ESRD O
have O
a O
higher O
preoperative O
and O
1-year O
serum O
creatinine O
and O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
hepatorenal O
syndrome. O
However, O
an O
increase O
of O
serum O
creatinine O
at O
various O
times O
postoperatively O
is O
more O
predictive O
of O
the O
development O
of O
CRF O
or O
ESRD. O

Patients O

There O
was O
no O

However, O
this O

only O

This O

the O
conclusion O
that O

Prospective O

The O
current O
study O
prospectively O
evaluated O
the O
magnitude, O
clinical O
course, O

and O
prognostic O
factors O
in O
ATT-ALF. O
From O
January O
1986 O
to O
January O
2009, O
1223 O
consecutive O
ALF O
patients O
were O
evaluated: O
ATT O
alone O
was O
the O
cause O
in O
70 O
(5.7%) O
patients. O
Another O
15 O
(1.2%) O
had O
ATT O
and O
simultaneous O
hepatitis B
virus I
infection. B
In O
44 O
(62.8%) O
patients, O
ATT O
was O
prescribed O
empirically O
without O
definitive O
evidence O
of O
tuberculosis. O
ATT-ALF O
patients O
were O
younger O
(32.87 O
[+/-15.8] O
years), O
and O
49 O
(70%) O
of O
them O
were O
women. O
Most O
had O
hyperacute O
presentation; O
the O
median O
icterus B
encephalopathy B
interval O
was O
4.5 O
(0-30) O
days. O
The O
median O
duration O
of O
ATT O
before O
ALF O
was O
30 O
(7-350) O
days. O
At O
presentation, O
advanced O
encephalopathy O
and O
cerebral B
edema I
were O
present O
in O
51 O
(76%) O
and O
29 O
(41.4%) O
patients, O
respectively. O
Gastrointestinal B

and O
acute B

were O
documented O
in O
seven O
(10%), O
five O
(7.1%), O
26 O
(37.1%), O
and O
seven O
(10%) O
patients, O
respectively. O
Compared O
with O
hepatitis B
E I
virus O
(HEV) O
and O
non-A O
non-E-induced O
ALF, O
ATT-ALF O
patients O
had O
nearly O
similar O
presentations O
except O
for O
older O
age O
and O
less O
elevation O
of O

enzymes. O
The O
mortality O
rate O
among O
patients O
with O
ATT-ALF O
was O
high O
(67.1%, O
n O
= O
47), O
and O
only O
23 O
(32.9%) O
patients O
recovered O
with O
medical O
treatment. O
In O
multivariate O
analysis, O
three O
factors O
independently O
predicted O
mortality: O
serum O
bilirubin O
(>or=10.8 O
mg/dL), O
prothrombin O
time O
(PT) O
prolongation O
(>or=26 O
seconds), O
and O

III/IV O
encephalopathy O
at O
presentation. O
CONCLUSION: O
ATT-ALF O
constituted O
5.7% O
of O
ALF O
at O
our O
center O
and O
had O
a O
high O
mortality O
rate. O
Because O
the O
mortality O
rate O
is O
so O
high, O
determining O
which O
factors O
are O
predictors O
is O
less O
important. O
A O
high O
proportion O
of O
patients O
had O
consumed O
ATT O

Both O
anti-arrhythmic O

the O
existence O
of O

We O
studied O
a O
patient O
with O

prior O
history O
of O
neuromuscular B
disease I
who O
became O
virtually O
quadriplegic B
after O
parenteral O
magnesium O
administration O
for O
preeclampsia. B
The O
serum O
magnesium O
concentration O
was O
3.0 O
mEq/L, O
which O
is O
usually O
well O
tolerated. O
The O
magnesium O
was O
stopped O
and O
she O
recovered O
over O
a O
few O
days. O
While O
she O
was O
weak, O
2-Hz O
repetitive O
stimulation O
revealed O
a O
decrement O
without O
significant O
facilitation O
at O
rapid O
rates O
or O
after O
exercise, O
suggesting O
postsynaptic B
neuromuscular I
blockade. I
After O
her O
strength O
returned, O
repetitive O
stimulation O
was O
normal, O
but O
single O
fiber O
EMG O
revealed O
increased O
jitter O
and O
blocking. O
Her O
acetylcholine O

antibody O
level O
was O
markedly O
elevated. O
Although O
paralysis B
after O
magnesium O

has O
been O
described O
in O
patients O
with O
known O
myasthenia B

it O
has O
not O
previously O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
the O
initial O

manifestation O
of O
the O
disease. O
Patients O
who O
are O
unusually O
sensitive O
to O
the O

should O
be O
suspected O
of O
having O
an O

The O
current O

aimed O
to O
assess O
the O

MDMA O
use O
on O
three O
separate O
central O

showed O
impairments O
in O

The O
latter O
two O
deficits O
remained O
significant O
after O
controlling O
for O
other O

These O
data O
lend O
further O
support O
to O
the O
proposal O
that O
cognitive O

The O

died O
seven O
days, O
the O
man O
four O
weeks O
after O
intrathecal O

Clinically, O
the O
onset O
was O
characterized O
by O
the O
signs O

and O
ascending O

Histological O

immunohistochemical O
investigations O
(HE-LFB, O

in O
areas O

A O

Immune O

(HBV) O
represent O
an O

because O
they O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
vaccine O
escape, O
HBV O
reactivation, O
and O

Recent O

immune O

in O
distinct O
peripheral O

We O
therefore O
systematically O
analyzed O
the O
functional O

of O
the O
most O

the O
sG145R O

and O
an O
HBeAg-negative O
background O
with O
precore O
(PC) O
and O
basal O

mutants. O
The O
sG145R O
mutation O
strongly O
reduced O
HBsAg O

and O
was O
able O
to O
fully O
restore O
the O

LAM-resistant O
HBV O
mutants O
to O
the O
levels O
of O
wild-type O
HBV, O
and O
PC O
or O
BCP O
mutations O
further O
enhanced O
viral O
replication. O
Although O
the O
sP120T O
substitution O
also O
impaired O
HBsAg O
secretion, O
it O
did O
not O
enhance O
the O
replication O
of O

However, O
the O
concomitant O
occurrence O
of O
HBeAg O
negativity O
(PC/BCP), O
sP120T, O
and O
LAM O
resistance O
resulted O
in O
the O
restoration O

levels O
of O
wild-type O
HBV. O
In O
all O
clones O
with O
combined O
immune O
escape O
and O
LAM O

mutations, O
the O
nucleotide O
analogues O
adefovir O
and O
tenofovir O
remained O
effective O
in O
suppressing O
viral O

These O
findings O
reveal O
the O
differential O
impact O
of O
immune O

variants O
on O
the O

Flestolol O
(ACC-9089) O
is O
a O
nonselective, O
competitive, O
ultra-short-acting O
beta-adrenergic O
blocking O
agent, O
without O
any O
intrinsic O
sympathomimetic O
activity. O
Flestolol O
is O
metabolized O
by O
plasma O
esterases O
and O
has O
an O
elimination O
half-life O
of O
approximately O
6.5 O
minutes. O
This O
agent O
was O
well O
tolerated O
in O
healthy O
volunteers O
at O
doses O
up O
to O
100 O
micrograms/kg/min. O
In O
long-term O
infusion O
studies, O
flestolol O
was O
well O
tolerated O
at O
the O
effective O
beta-blocking O
dose O
(5 O
micrograms/kg/min) O
for O
up O
to O
seven O
days. O
Flestolol O
blood O
concentrations O
increased O
linearly O
with O
increasing O
dose O
and O
good O
correlation O
exists O
between O
blood O
concentrations O
of O
flestolol O
and O
beta-adrenergic O
blockade. O
Flestolol O
produced O
a O
dose-dependent O
attenuation O
of O
isoproterenol-induced O
tachycardia. B
Electrophysiologic O
and O
hemodynamic O
effects O
of O
flestolol O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
other O
beta O
blockers. O
In O
contrast O
with O
other O
beta O
blockers, O
flestolol-induced O
effects O
reverse O
rapidly O
(within O
30 O
minutes) O
following O
discontinuation O
because O
of O
its O
short O
half-life. O
Flestolol O
effectively O
reduced O
heart O
rate O
in O
patients O
with O
supraventricular B
tachyarrhythmia. I
In O
patients O
with O
unstable B
angina, I
flestolol O
infusion O
was O
found O
to O
be O
safe O
and O
effective O
in O
controlling O
chest B
pain. I
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
flestolol O
is O
a O
potent, O
well-tolerated, O
ultra-short-acting O
beta-adrenergic O
blocking O
agent. O

Analysis O

It O
is O
concluded O
that O
increases O
in O
the O

are O
characteristic O
of O
a O

MESSAGE: O
Capecitabine O
is O
an O
oral O
prodrug O
of O
5-FU O
and O
was O
developed O
to O
fulfill O
the O
need O
for O
a O
more O
convenient O
therapy O
and O
provide O
an O
improved O
safety/efficacy O

chemotherapeutic O
agents O
in O
colorectal, B

The O
most O
commonly O
reported O
toxic O
effects O
of O
capecitabine O
are O
diarrhea, B
nausea, B
vomiting, B
stomatitis B
and O
hand-foot B

Capecitabine O
has O
a O
well-established O
safety O
profile O
and O
can O
be O
given O
safely O
to O
patients O
with O
advanced O

hepatic B
and I
renal B
dysfunctions. I

The O
present O
study O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
anticonvulsant O
activity O
as O
well O
as O
the O
effects O
on O
the O
level O
of O
hippocampal O
amino O
acid O
neurotransmitters O
(glutamate, O
aspartate, O
glycine O
and O
GABA) O
of O
N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea O
(VPU) O
in O
comparison O
to O
its O
parent O
compound, O
valproic O
acid O
(VPA). O
VPU O
was O
more O
potent O
than O
VPA, O
exhibiting O
the O
median O
effective O
dose O
(ED(50)) O
of O
49 O
mg/kg O
in O
protecting O
rats O
against O
pilocarpine-induced O
seizure B
whereas O
the O
corresponding O
value O
for O
VPA O
was O
322 O
mg/kg. O
In O
vivo O
microdialysis O
demonstrated O
that O
an O
intraperitoneal O
administration O
of O
pilocarpine O
induced O
a O
pronounced O
increment O
of O
hippocampal O
glutamate O
and O
aspartate O
whereas O
no O
significant O
change O
was O
observed O
on O
the O
level O
of O
glycine O
and O
GABA. O
Pretreatment O
with O
either O
VPU O
(50 O
and O
100 O
mg/kg) O
or O
VPA O
(300 O
and O
600 O
mg/kg) O
completely O
abolished O
pilocarpine-evoked O
increases O
in O
extracellular O
glutamate O
and O
aspartate. O
In O
addition, O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction O
was O
also O
observed O
on O
the O
level O
of O
GABA O
and O
glycine O
but O
less O
than O
a O
drastic O
reduction O
of O
glutamate O
and O
aspartate O
level. O
Based O
on O
the O
finding O
that O
VPU O
and O
VPA O
could O
protect O
the O
animals O
against O
pilocarpine-induced O
seizure O
it O
is O
suggested O
that O
the O
reduction O
of O
inhibitory O
amino O
acid O
neurotransmitters O
was O
comparatively O
minor O
and O
offset O
by O
a O
pronounced O
reduction O
of O
glutamate O
and O
aspartate. O
Therefore, O
like O
VPA, O
the O
finding O
that O
VPU O
could O
drastically O
reduce O
pilocarpine-induced O
increases O
in O
glutamate O
and O
aspartate O
should O
account, O
at O
least O
partly, O
for O
its O
anticonvulsant O
activity O
observed O
in O
pilocarpine-induced O
seizure O
in O
experimental O
animals. O
Some O
other O
mechanism O
than O
those O
being O
reported O
herein O
should O
be O
further O
investigated. O

attaining O
at O

a O
15% O
increase O
in O
the O
FEV1 O
(responders) O
were O
31% O
and O
90%, O
respectively, O
for O
ipratropium O
and O
17% O
and O
50%, O
respectively, O
for O
theophylline. O
The O
average O
FEV1 O
increases O
during O
the O
6-hour O
observation O
period O
were O
18% O
for O
ipratropium O
and O
8% O
for O
theophylline. O
The O
mean O
duration O
of O
action O
was O
3.8 O
hours O
with O
ipratropium O
and O
2.4 O
hours O
with O
theophylline. O
While O
side O
effects O
were O
rare, O
those O
experienced O
after O
theophylline O
use O
did O
involve O
the O
cardiovascular B

These O
results O
show O
that O
ipratropium O
is O
a O
more O
potent O
bronchodilator O
than O
oral O
theophylline O
in O

BACKGROUND: O
patients O
undergoing O
electroconvulsive O
therapy O
(ECT) O
often O
receive O
succinylcholine O
as O
part O
of O
the O
anesthetic O
procedure. O
The O
duration O
of O
action O
may O
be O
prolonged O
in O
patients O
with O
genetic O
variants O
of O
the O
butyrylcholinesterase O
enzyme O
(BChE), O
the O
most O
common O
being O
the O
K- O
and O
the O
A-variants. O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
assess O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
genetic O
variants O
in O
butyrylcholinesterase O
gene O
(BCHE) O
in O
patients O
with O
a O
suspected O
prolonged O
duration O
of O
action O
of O
succinylcholine O
after O
ECT. O
METHODS: O
a O
total O
of O
13 O
patients O
were O
referred O
to O
the O
Danish O
Cholinesterase O
Research O
Unit O
after O
ECT O
during O
38 O
months. O
We O
determined O
the O
BChE O
activity O
and O
the O
BCHE O
genotype O
using O
molecular O
genetic O
methods, O
the O
duration O
of O
apnea, B
time O
to O
sufficient O
spontaneous O
ventilation O
and O
whether O
neuromuscular O
monitoring O
was O
used. O
The O
duration O
of O
apnea O
was O
compared O
with O
published O
data O
on O
normal O
subjects. O
RESULTS: O
in O
11 O
patients, O
mutations O
were O
found O
in O
the O
BCHE O
gene, O
the O
K-variant O
being O
the O
most O
frequent. O
The O
duration O
of O
apnea O
was O
5-15 O
min O
compared O
with O
3-5.3 O
min O
from O
the O
literature. O
Severe O
distress O
was O
noted O
in O
the O
recovery O
phase O
in O
two O
patients. O
Neuromuscular O
monitoring O
was O
used O
in O
two O
patients. O
CONCLUSION: O
eleven O
of O
13 O
patients O
with O
a O
prolonged O
duration O
of O
action O
of O
succinylcholine O
had O
mutations O
in O
BCHE, O
indicating O
that O
this O
is O
the O
possible O
reason O
for O
a O
prolonged O
period O
of O
apnea. O
We O
recommend O
objective O
neuromuscular O
monitoring O
during O
the O
first O
ECT. O

A O
patient O
with O
cryptogenic O
cirrhosis B
and O
disseminated O
sporotrichosis B
developed O
acute B
renal I
failure I
immediately O
following O
the O
administration O
of O
amphotericin O
B O
on O
four O
separate O
occasions. O
The O
abruptness O
of O
the O
renal O
failure O
and O
its O
reversibility O
within O
days O
suggests O
that O
there O
was O
a O
functional O
component O
to O
the O
renal B
dysfunction. I
We O
propose O
that O
amphotericin, O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
reduced O
effective O
arterial O
volume, O
may O
activate O
tubuloglomerular O
feedback, O
thereby O
contributing O
to O
acute O
renal O
failure. O

Peripheral B
neuropathy B
has O
been O
noted O
as O
a O
complication O
of O
therapy O
with O
perhexiline O
maleate, O
a O
drug O
widely O
used O
in O
France O
(and O
in O
clinical O
trials O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
for O
the O
prophylactic O
treatment O
of O
angina B
pectoris. I
In O
24 O
patients O
with O
this O
complication, O
the O
marked O
slowing O
of O
motor O
nerve O
conduction O
velocity O
and O
the O
electromyographic O
changes O
imply O
mainly O
a O
demyelinating B
disorder. I
Improvement O
was O
noted O
with O
cessation O
of O
therapy. O
In O
a O
few O
cases O
the O
presence O
of O
active O
denervation O
signified O
a O
poor O
prognosis, O
with O
only O
slight O
improvement. O
The O
underlying O
mechanism O
causing O
the O
neuropathy O
is O
not O
yet O
fully O
known, O
although O
some O
evidence O
indicates O
that O
it O
may O
be O
a O
lipid O
storage O
process. O

Suxamethonium O
causes O
prolonged O
apnea B
in O
patients O
in O
whom O
pseudocholinesterase O
enzyme O

(OP) O
poisons. O
Here, O
we O
present O
a O
similar O
incident O
in O
a O
severely O
depressed B
patient O
who O
received O
electroconvulsive O
therapy O
(ECT). O
Prolonged O
apnea O
in O
our O
case O
ensued O
because O
the O
information O
about O
suicidal O
attempt O
by O
OP O
compound O
was O
concealed O
from O
the O
treating O
team. O

The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
report O
our O
experience O
concerning O
the O

of O
the O

positive O
patients O
with O
rheumatologic B

who O
were O
on O
both O

and O
HBV O
DNA O
levels O
of O
the O
patients O
during O

were O
obtained O
from O

Eleven O
patients O
(six O

with O
median O
age O
47 O
years O
(range O
27-73), O
median O
disease O
duration O
50 O
months O
(range O
9-178) O
and O
median O
follow-up O
period O
of O
patients O
13.8 O
months O
(range O
5-27) O
were O
enrolled O
in O
this O
study. O
Lamivudine O
therapy O
was O
started O
3-7 O
days O
prior O
to O
immunosuppressive O
therapy O
in O
all O
patients. O
Baseline, O
liver O
function O
tests O
were O
elevated O
in O
two O
patients O
(fourth O
patient: O

IU/l, O
AST:111 O

IU/l, O
AST:274 O
IU/l, O
with O
minimal O
changes O
in O
the O

in O
both). O
Shortly O
after O
treatment O
their O
tests O
normalized O
and O
during O
follow-up O
period O
none O
of O
the O
patients O
had O
abnormal B
liver I
function I
tests. O
In O
four O
patients O
HBV O
DNA O
levels O
were O
higher O
than O
normal O
at O
baseline. O
Two O
of O
these O
normalized O
and O
the O
others O
increased O
later. O
In O
three O
additional O
patients, O
HBV O
DNA O
levels O
were O
increased O
during O
follow-up. O
None O
of O
the O
patients O
had O
significant O
clinical O
sings O
of O
HBV O
activation. O
Lamivudine O
was O
well O
tolerated O
and O
was O
continued O
in O
all O
patients. O
Prophylactic O
administration O
of O
lamivudine O
in O
patients O
who O
required O
immunosuppressive O
therapy O
seems O
to O
be O
safe, O
well O
tolerated O
and O
effective O
in O
preventing O
HBV O
reactivation. O

and O
1991, O
8 O
children O
(1.46%) O

with O
those O
of O
two O
control O
groups O
matched O
for O
gestation O

and O
for O
perinatal O
complications. O
Our O
observations O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
of O
hearing O

with O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
perinatal O
complications. O
Ototoxicity B
appeared O
closely O
related O
to O
a O
prolonged O
administration O
and O
higher O
total O
dose O
of O
ototoxic B
drugs, O
particularly O
aminoglycosides O
and O

Finally, O
we O
strongly O
recommend O
to O
prospectively O
and O
regularly O
perform O
audiologic O
assessment O
in O

Heparan O
sulphate-associated O
anionic O

in O
the O

employing O
the O

Morphometric O
analysis O
at O
the O
ultrastructural O

was O
performed O
using O
a O
computerized O

The O
heparan O
sulphate O
specificity O
of O
the O
cuprolinic O

was O
demonstrated O
by O
glycosaminoglycan-degrading O
enzymes, O
showing O
that O
pretreatment O
of O
the O
sections O
with O
heparitinase O
abolished O
all O

whereas O
chondroitinase O

had O
no O

The O
majority O
of O
anionic O
sites O
(74% O
in O
diabetic B
and O
81% O
in O
control O
rats) O
were O
found O
within O
the O
lamina O

of O
the O
glomerular O

A O
minority O
of O
anionic O
sites O
were O
scattered O
throughout O
the O
lamina O

were O
significantly O

(p<0.001 O
and O
p<0.01 O
for O
diabetic O

respectively). O
Diabetic B
rats O
progressively O
developed O
albuminuria B
reaching O
40.3 O
(32.2-62.0) O

At O

in O
the O

of O
the O

We O
conclude O
that O
in O
streptozotocin-diabetic O

a O

Induction O
of O
intravascular B
coagulation I

inhibition O
of O
fibrinolysis O
by O
injection O
of O
thrombin O
and O
tranexamic O
acid O
(AMCA) O
in O
the O
rat O
gives O
rise O
to O
pulmonary B
and I
renal B
insufficiency I
resembling O
that O
occurring O
after O
trauma B
or O
sepsis B
in O
man. O
Injection O
of O
Captopril O
(1 O
mg/kg), O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
angiotensin O
converting O
enzyme O
(ACE), O
reduced O
both O
pulmonary O
and O
renal O
insufficiency O
in O
this O
rat O
model. O
The O
lung O
weights O
were O
lower O
and O
PaO2 O
was O
improved O
in O
rats O
given O
this O
enzyme-blocking O
agent. O
The O
contents O
of O
albumin O
in O
the O
lungs O
were O
not O
changed, O
indicating O
that O
Captopril O
did O
not O
influence O
the O
extravasation O
of O
protein. O
Renal B
damage I
as O
reflected O
by O
an O
increase O
in O
serum O
urea O
and O
in O
kidney O
weight O
was O
prevented O
by O
Captopril. O
The O
amount O
of O
fibrin O
in O
the O
kidneys O
was O
also O
considerably O
lower O
than O
in O
animals O
which O
received O
thrombin O
and O
AMCA O
alone. O
It O
is O
suggested O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
Captopril O
on O
the O
lungs O
may O
be O
attributable O
to O
a O
vasodilatory O
effect O
due O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
circulating O
level O
of O
Angiotension O
II O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
prostacyclin O
(secondary O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
bradykinin). O
Captopril O
may, O
by O
the O
same O
mechanism, O
reduce O
the O
increase O
in O
glomerular O
filtration O
that O
is O
known O
to O
occur O
after O
an O
injection O
of O
thrombin, O
thereby O
diminishing O
the O
aggregation O
of O
fibrin O
monomers O
in O
the O
glomeruli, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
less O
fibrin O
will O
be O
deposited O
and O
thus O
less O
kidney B
damage I
will O
be O
produced. O

BACKGROUND: O
Cyclooxygenase O
(COX) O
inhibitors O
are O
one O
of O
the O
most O
often O
ingested O
drugs O
during O
pregnancy. O
Unlike O
general O
toxicity B
data, O
their O
prenatal O
toxic O
effects O
were O
not O
extensively O
studied O
before. O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
experiment O
was O
to O
evaluate O
the O
developmental O
toxicity O
of O
the O
non-selective O
(piroxicam) O
and O
selective O
(DFU; O
5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) O
phenyl-2(5H)-furanon) O
COX-2 O
inhibitors. O
METHODS: O
Drugs O
were O
separately, O
orally O
once O
daily O
dosed O
to O
pregnant O
rats O
from O
day O
8 O
to O
21 O
(GD1=plug O
day). O
Doses O
were O
set O
at O
0.3, O
3.0 O
and O
30.0mg/kg O
for O
piroxicam O
and O
0.2, O
2.0 O
and O
20.0mg/kg O
for O
DFU. O
Fetuses O
were O
delivered O
on O
GD O
21 O
and O
routinely O
examined. O
Comprehensive O
clinical O
and O
developmental O
measurements O
were O
done. O
The O
pooled O
statistical O
analysis O
for O
ventricular B
septal I
(VSD) I
and I

(MD) I
defects I
was O
performed O
for O

exposed O
to O
piroxicam, O
selective O
and O
non-selective O
COX-2 O
inhibitor O
based O
on O
present O
and O
historic O
data. O
RESULTS: O
Maternal O
toxicity, O
intrauterine B
growth I
retardation, I
and O
increase B
of I
external I
and I
skeletal I
variations I
were O
found O
in O
rats O
treated O
with O
the O
highest O

of O
piroxicam. O
Decrease O
of O

the O
only O
signs O
of O
the O
DFU O
developmental O
toxicity O
observed O
in O
pups O
exposed O
to O
the O
highest O
compound O
dose. O
Lack O
of O
teratogenicity O
was O
found O
in O
piroxicam O
and O
DFU-exposed O
groups. O
Prenatal O
exposure O
to O
non-selective O
COX O
inhibitors O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
VSD O
and O
MD O
when O
compared O
to O
historic O
control O
but O
not O
with O
selective O
COX-2 O
inhibitors. O
CONCLUSION: O
Both O
selective O
and O
non-selective O
COX-2 O
inhibitors O
were O
toxic O
for O
rats O
fetuses O
when O
administered O
in O
the O
highest O
dose. O
Unlike O
DFU, O
piroxicam O
was O
also O
highly O
toxic O
to O
the O
dams. O
Prenatal O
exposure O
to O

does O
not O
increase O
the O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
describe O
a O
case O
of O
propylthiouracil-induced O
vasculitis B
manifesting O
with O
pericarditis. B
METHODS: O
We O
present O
the O
first O
case O
report O
of O
a O
woman O
with O
hyperthyroidism B
treated O
with O
propylthiouracil O
in O
whom O
a O
syndrome O
of O
pericarditis, O
fever, B
and O
glomerulonephritis B
developed. O
Serologic O
testing O
and O
immunologic O
studies O
were O
done, O
and O
a O
pericardial O
biopsy O
was O
performed. O
RESULTS: O
A O
25-year-old O
woman O
with O
Graves' B
disease I
had O
a O
febrile B
illness I
and O
evidence O
of O
pericarditis, O
which O
was O
confirmed O
by O
biopsy. O
Serologic O
evaluation O
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
perinuclear-staining O
antineutrophil O
cytoplasmic O
autoantibodies O
(pANCA) O
against O
myeloperoxidase O
(MPO). O
Propylthiouracil O
therapy O
was O
withdrawn, O
and O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
a O
1-month O
course O
of O
prednisone, O
which O
alleviated O
her O
symptoms. O
A O
literature O
review O
revealed O
no O
prior O
reports O
of O
pericarditis O
in O
anti-MPO O
pANCA-positive O
vasculitis O
associated O
with O
propylthio- O
uracil O
therapy. O
CONCLUSION: O
Pericarditis B
may O
be O
the O
initial O
manifestation O
of O
drug-induced O
vasculitis O
attributable O
to O
propylthio- O
uracil O
therapy. O

Cross-sectional O
echocardiography O
was O
used O
to O
evaluate O
two O
neonates O
whose O
mothers O
ingested O
lithium O
during O
pregnancy. O
In O
one O
infant, O
Ebstein's B
anomaly I
of O
the O
tricuspid O
valve O
was O
identified. O
In O
the O
other O
infant O
cross-sectional O
echocardiography O
provided O
reassurance O
that O
the O
infant O
did O
not O
have O
Ebstein's O
anomaly. O
Cross-sectional O
echocardiographic O
screening O
of O
newborns O
exposed O
to O
lithium O
during O
gestation O
can O
provide O
highly O
accurate, O
noninvasive O
assessment O
of O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
lithium-induced O
cardiac B
malformations. I

BACKGROUND: O
Lithium O
remains O
a O
first-line O
treatment O
for O
the O
acute O
and O
maintenance O
treatment O
of O
bipolar B
disorder. I
Although O
much O
has O
been O
written O
about O
the O
management O
of O
the O
more O
common O
adverse O
effects O
of O
lithium, O
such O
as O
polyuria B
and O
tremor, B
more O
subtle O
lithium O
side O
effects O
such O
as O
cognitive B
deficits, I
loss B
of I
creativity, I
and O
functional B
impairments I
remain O
understudied. O
This O
report O
summarizes O
our O
experience O
in O
switching O
bipolar O
patients O
from O
lithium O
to O
divalproex O
sodium O
to O
alleviate O
such O
cognitive B
and I
functional I
impairments. I
METHOD: O
Open, O
case O
series O
design. O
RESULTS: O
We O
report O
seven O
cases O
where O
substitution O
of O
lithium, O
either O
fully O
or O
partially, O
with O
divalproex O
sodium O
was O
extremely O
helpful O
in O
reducing O
the O
cognitive, B
motivational, I
or I
creative I
deficits I
attributed O
to O
lithium O
in O
our O
bipolar O
patients. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
this O
preliminary O
report, O
divalproex O
sodium O
was O
a O
superior O
alternative O
to O
lithium O
in O
bipolar O
patients O
experiencing O
cognitive O
deficits, O
loss O
of O
creativity, O
and O
functional O
impairments. O

The O

the I
renal I
pelvis, I
ureter I

associated O
with O
consumption O
of O
either O
phenacetin O

was O
calculated O
from O
data O
acquired O
by O
questionnaire O
from O
381 O
cases O
and O
808 O
controls. O
The O
risk O
of O
renal O
papillary O
necrosis O
was O
increased O
nearly O
20-fold O
by O
consumption O
of O
phenacetin, O
which O
also O
increased O
the O
risk O
for O
cancer B
of I
the I
renal I
pelvis I
and I
bladder I
but O
not O
for O
ureteric B
cancer. I
By O
contrast, O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
substantiate O
an O
increased O
risk O
from O
paracetamol O
consumption O
for O
renal O
papillary O
necrosis O
or O
any O
of O
these O
cancers B
although O
there O
was O
a O
suggestion O
of O
an O
association O
with O
cancer B
of I
the I

In O
both O

AIM: O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
documentation O
of O
this O
clinical O
case O
is O
to O
make O
clinicians O
aware O
of O
"meth O
mouth" B
and I
the O
medical O
risks O
associated O
with O
this O
serious O
condition. O
BACKGROUND: O
Methamphetamine O
is O
a O
very O
addictive, O
powerful O
stimulant O
that O
increases O
wakefulness O
and O
physical O
activity O
and O
can O
produce O
other O
effects O
such O
as O
cardiac B
dysrhythmias, I
hypertension, B
hallucinations, B
and O
violent B
behavior. I
Dental O
patients O
abusing O
methamphetamine O
can O
present O
with O
poor O
oral O
hygiene, O
xerostomia, B
rampant O
caries B
("meth O
mouth"), O
and O
excessive O
tooth B
wear. I
Oral O
rehabilitation O
of O
patients O
using O
methamphetamine O
can O
be O
challenging. O
CASE O
DESCRIPTION: O
A O
30-year-old O
Caucasian O
woman O
presented O
with O
dental O
pain, B
bad B
breath, I
and O
self-reported O
poor O
esthetics. O
A O
comprehensive O
examination O
including O
her O
medical O
history, O
panoramic O
radiograph, O
and O
intraoral O
examination O
revealed O
19 O
carious B
lesions, I
which O
is O
not O
very O
common O
for O
a O
healthy O
adult. O
She O
reported O
her O
use O
of O
methamphetamine O
for O
five O
years O
and O
had O
not O
experienced O
any O
major O
carious B
episodes I
before O
she O
started O
using O
the O
drug. O
SUMMARY: O
The O
patient's O
medical O
and O
dental O
histories O
along O
with O
radiographic O
and O
clinical O
findings O
lead O
to O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
"meth O
mouth." O
Although O
three O
different O
dental O
treatment O
modalities O
(either O
conventional O
or O
implant-supported) O
have O
been O
offered O
to O
the O
patient O
since O
August O
2007, O
the O
patient O
has O
yet O
to O
initiate O
any O
treatment. O
CLINICAL O
SIGNIFICANCE: O
This O
clinical O
case O
showing O
oral O
manifestations O
of O
meth O
mouth O
was O
presented O
to O
help O
dental O
practitioners O
recognize O
and O
manage O
patients O
who O
may O
be O
abusing O
methamphetamines. O
Dental O
practitioners O
also O
may O
be O
skeptical O
about O
the O
reliability O
of O
appointment O
keeping O
by O
these O
patients, O
as O
they O
frequently O
miss O
their O
appointments O
without O
reasonable O
justification. O

Perhexiline O
maleate O
and O
peripheral B
neuropathy. I

Hyperkalemia B
has O
recently O
been O
recognized O
as O
a O
complication O
of O
nonsteroidal O
antiinflammatory O
agents O
(NSAID) O
such O
as O
indomethacin. O
Several O
recent O
studies O
have O
stressed O
the O
renal O
sparing O
features O
of O
sulindac, O
owing O
to O
its O
lack O
of O
interference O
with O
renal O
prostacyclin O
synthesis. O
We O
describe O
4 O
patients O
in O
whom O
hyperkalemia B
ranging O
from O
6.1 O
to O
6.9 O
mEq/l O
developed O
within O
3 O
to O
8 O
days O
of O
sulindac O
administration. O
In O
all O
of O
them O
normal O
serum O
potassium O
levels O
reached O
within O
2 O
to O
4 O
days O
of O
stopping O
sulindac. O
As O
no O
other O
medications O
known O
to O
effect O
serum O
potassium O
had O
been O
given O
concomitantly, O
this O
course O
of O
events O
is O
suggestive O
of O
a O
cause-and-effect O
relationship O
between O
sulindac O
and O
hyperkalemia. O
These O
observations O
indicate O
that O
initial O
hopes O
that O
sulindac O
may O
not O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
adverse O
renal O
effects O
of O
other O
NSAID O
are O
probably O
not O
justified. O

Partial O
lesions O
were O
made O
with O
kainic O
acid O
in O
the O
interpeduncular O
nucleus O
of O
the O
ventral O
midbrain O
of O
the O
rat. O
Compared O
with O
sham-operated O
controls, O
lesions O
significantly O
(p O
< O
0.25) O
blunted O
the O
early O
(<60 O
min) O
free-field O
locomotor B
hypoactivity I
caused O
by O
nicotine O
(0.5 O
mg O
kg(-1), O
i.m.), O
enhanced O
the O
later O
(60-120 O
min) O
nicotine-induced O
hyperactivity, B
and O
raised O
spontaneous O
nocturnal O
activity. O
Lesions O
reduced O
the O
extent O
of O
immunohistological O
staining O
for O
choline O
acetyltransferase O
in O
the O
interpeduncular O
nucleus O
(p O
<0.025), O
but O
not O
for O
tyrosine O
hydroxylase O
in O
the O
surrounding O
catecholaminergic O
A10 O
region. O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
interpeduncular O
nucleus O
mediates O
nicotinic O
depression B
of O
locomotor O
activity O
and O
dampens O
nicotinic O
arousal O
mechanisms O
located O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
brain. O

Idiopathic B
subjective I
tinnitus B
(IST) O
is B
one O
of O
the O
most O
obscure O
otological O
pathologies. O
This O
paper O
presents O
the O
results O
of O
treating O
IST O
by O
intratympanic O
instillation O
of O
lignocaine O
(lidocaine) O
2 O
per O
cent O
through O
a O
grommet, O
for O
five O
weekly O
courses. O
Fifty-two O
patients O
suffering O
from O
intractable O
tinnitus O
entered O
this O
therapeutic O
trial, O
but O
only O
nine O
finished O
all O
five O
courses. O
In O
one O
patient, O
the O
tinnitus O
was O
almost O
completely O
abolished, O
but O
in O
all O
the O
nine O
patients O
the O
decompensated O
tinnitus O
changed O
to O
a O
compensated O
one. O
We O
suggest O
this O
mode O
of O
treatment O
for O
patients O
that O
were O
previously O
treated O
by O
drugs, O
acupuncture O
and O
biofeedback, O
with O
disappointing O
results. O
Patients O
should O
be O
warned O
about O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
vertigo B
and O
vomiting, B
which O
subsides O
gradually O
with O
every O
new O
instillation, O
and O
that O
the O
tinnitus O
may O
not O
disappear O
but O
will O
be O
alleviated, O
enabling O
them O
to O
cope O
more O
easily O
with O
the O
disease O
and O
lead O
a O
more O
normal O
life. O

OBJECTIVE: O
This O

MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
From O
November O
2005 O
to O
September O
2007, O
8 O
patients O
(5 O
men O
and O
3 O
women) O
were O
diagnosed O
as O
having O
metronidazole-induced O
encephalopathy O
(age O
range; O
43-78 O
years). O
They O
had O
been O
taking O
metronidazole O
(total O
dosage, O
45-120 O
g; O
duration, O
30 O
days O
to O
2 O
months) O
to O
treat O
the O
infection B
in O
various O
organs. O
Initial O
brain O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
(MRI) O
were O
obtained O
after O
the O
hospitalization, O
including O
DWI O
(8/8), O
apparent O
diffusion O
coefficient O
(ADC) O
map O
(4/8), O
FLAIR O
(7/8), O
and O
T2-weighted O
image O
(8/8). O
Follow-up O
MRIs O
were O
performed O
on O
5 O
patients O
from O
third O
to O
14th O
days O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
metronidazole O
administration. O
Findings O
of O
initial O
and O
follow-up O
MRIs O
were O
retrospectively O
evaluated O
by O
2 O
neuroradiologists O
by O
consensus, O
to O
analyze O
the O
presence O
of O
abnormal O
signal O
intensities, O
their O
locations, O
and O
signal O
changes O
on O
follow-up O
images. O
RESULTS: O
Initial O
MRIs O
showed O
abnormal O
high O
signal O
intensities O
on O
DWI O
and O
FLAIR O
(or O
T2-weighted O
image) O
at O
the O
dentate O
nucleus O
(8/8), O
inferior O
colliculus O
(6/8), O
corpus O
callosum O
(2/8), O
pons O
(2/8), O
medulla O
(1/8), O
and O
bilateral O
cerebral O
white O
matter O
(1/8). O
High-signal O
intensity O
lesions O
on O
DWI O
tended O
to O
show O
low O
signal O
intensity O
on O
ADC O
map O
(3/4), O
but O
in O
one O
patient, O
high O
signal O
intensity O
was O
shown O
at O
bilateral O
dentate O
nuclei O
on O
not O
only O
DWI O
but O
also O
ADC O
map. O
All O
the O
lesions O
in O
dentate, O
inferior O
colliculus, O
pons, O
and O
medullas O
had O
been O
resolved O
completely O
on O
follow-up O
MRIs O
in O
5 O
patients, O
but O
in O
1 O
patient O
of O
them, O
corpus O
callosal B
lesion I
persisted. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Reversible O
inferior O
colliculus O
lesions O
could O
be O
considered O
as O
the O
characteristic O
for O
metronidazole-induced O
encephalopathy, O
next O
to O
the O
dentate O
nucleus O
involvement. O

BACKGROUND: O

STUDY O
DESIGN O
AND O
METHODS: O
Plasma O
samples O
from O
before O
and O
after O
CPB O
were O
analyzed O
postoperatively O
for O
argatroban O
concentration O
using O
a O
modified O
ecarin O

(ECT) O
assay. O
RESULTS: O
Unexpectedly O
high O
concentrations O
of O
argatroban O
were O
measured O
in O
these O
samples O
(range, O
0-32 O
microg/mL), O
and O
a O

39-51 O
minutes O
[< O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Correlation O
of O
plasma O
argatroban O
concentration O
versus O
the O
patient's O
coagulation O
variables O
and O
clinical O
course O
suggest O
that O
prolonged O
elevated O
levels O
of O
plasma O
argatroban O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
patient's O
extended O
coagulopathy. B
Because O
DTIs O
do O
not O
have O
reversal O
agents, O
surgical O
teams O
and O
transfusion O
services O
should O
remain O
aware O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
massive O
transfusion O
events O
during O
anticoagulation O
with O
these O
agents. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
report O

in O
the O
context O
of O

the O
effects O
of O
bromocriptine O
on O
prolactinoma B

in O

1 O
h O
and O
6 O
h O
after O
injection O
of O
bromocriptine O
(3 O
mg/kg O
of O
body O
weight). O
One O
h O
after O
treatment, O
serum O
prolactin O
levels O
decreased O
markedly. O
Electron O
microscopy O
disclosed O
many O
secretory O
granules, O
slightly O
distorted O
rough O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
and O
partially O
dilated O
Golgi O
cisternae O
in O
the O
prolactinoma O
cells. O
Morphometric O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
volume O
density O
of O
secretory O
granules O
increased, O
while O
the O
volume O
density O
of O
cytoplasmic O
microtubules O
decreased. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
lowered O
serum O
prolactin O
levels O
in O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
bromocriptine O
treatment O
may O
result O
from O
an O
impaired O
secretion O
of O
prolactin O
due O
to O
decreasing O
numbers O
of O
cytoplasmic O
microtubules. O
At O
6 O
h O
after O
injection, O
serum O
prolactin O
levels O
were O
still O
considerably O
lower O
than O
in O
controls. O
The O
prolactinoma O
cells O
at O
this O
time O
were O
well O
granulated, O
with O
vesiculated O
rough O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
and O
markedly O
dilated O
Golgi O
cisternae. O
Electron O
microscopical O
immunohistochemistry O
revealed O
positive O
reaction O
products O
noted O
on O
the O
secretory O
granules, O
Golgi O
cisternae, O
and O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
of O
the O
untreated O
rat O
prolactinoma O
cells. O
However, O
only O
secretory O

showed O
the O
positive O
reaction O
products O
for O
prolactin O
6 O
h O
after O
bromocriptine O
treatment O
of O
the O
adenoma B

was O
determined O
by O

suggesting O
that O
bromocriptine O
inhibits O

The O
development O
of O
thrombotic B

(TMA) O
associated B
with O
the O
use O
of O
cyclosporine O
has O
been O
well O
documented. O
Treatments O
have O
included O
discontinuation O
or O
reduction O
of O

dose O
with O
or O
without O
concurrent O
plasma O
exchange, O
plasma O
infusion, O
anticoagulation, O
and O

However, O
for O
recipients O
of O

transplantation, O
removing O
the O
inciting O
agent O
is O
not O
without O
the O
attendant O
risk O
of O
precipitating O
acute O
rejection O
and O

loss. O
The O
last O
decade O
has O
seen O
the O
emergence O
of O
tacrolimus O
as O
a O
potent O
immunosuppressive O
agent O
with O
mechanisms O
of O
action O
virtually O
identical O
to O
those O
of O
cyclosporine. O
As O
a O
result, O
switching O
to O
tacrolimus O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
viable O
therapeutic O
option O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
cyclosporine-induced O
TMA. O
With O
the O
more O
widespread O
application O
of O
tacrolimus O
in O
organ O
transplantation, O
tacrolimus-associated O
TMA O
has O
also O
been O
recognized. O
However, O
literature O
regarding O
the O
incidence O
of O
the O
recurrence O
of O
TMA O
in O
patients O
exposed O
sequentially O
to O
cyclosporine O
and O
tacrolimus O
is O
limited. O
We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
a O
living O
donor O
renal O
transplant O
recipient O
who O
developed O
cyclosporine-induced O
TMA O
that O
responded O
to O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
cyclosporine O
in O
conjunction O
with O
plasmapheresis O
and O
fresh O

Patients O

examined O
the O
effect O
of O
systemic O

of O
ketamine O

lidocaine O
on O
brush-evoked O
(dynamic) O

and O

(static) O
hyperalgesia B
induced O
by O
capsaicin. O
In O
a O
randomized, O
double-blind, O
placebo-controlled, O
crossover O
study, O
we O
studied O
12 O
volunteers O
in O
three O
experiments. O
Capsaicin O
100 O
micrograms O
was O
injected O
intradermally O
on O
the O

followed O
by O
an O
i.v. O
infusion O
of O
ketamine O
(bolus O

over O
10 O
min O
followed O
by O

of O
7 O
micrograms O

for O
50 O
min. O
Infusion O
started O
15 O
min O
after O

The O
following O
were O
measured: O
spontaneous O
pain, O
pain O
evoked O
by O
punctate O
and O
brush O
stimuli O
(VAS), O
and O
areas O
of O
brush-evoked O
and O
punctate-evoked O
hyperalgesia. O
Ketamine O
reduced O
both O
the O
area O
of O
brush-evoked O
and O
punctate-evoked O
hyperalgesia O
significantly O
and O
it O
tended O
to O
reduce O
brush-evoked O
pain. O
Lidocaine O
reduced O
the O
area O
of O
punctate-evoked O
hyperalgesia O
significantly. O
It O
tended O
to O
reduce O
VAS O
scores O
of O
spontaneous O
pain O
but O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
evoked O
pain. O
The O
differential O
effects O
of O
ketamine O
and O
lidocaine O
on O
static O
and O
dynamic O
hyperalgesia O
suggest O
that O
the O
two O
types O
of O
hyperalgesia O
are O
mediated O
by O
separate O

and O
have O
a O
distinct O

and O
its O

were O
estimated O
by O

in O
a O

The O
most O
striking O
effect O
was O

which O
increased O
with O

The O

were O
apparent O
earlier O
and O
sometimes O
lasted O
longer O
than O
those O
following O

administration. O
Dizziness B
was O
less O

There O
was O

Treatment O
with O
150 O
mg/kg O
PDTC O
before O

increased O
the O

In O
conclusion, O
the O

PDTC O
protected O
the O

whereas O
it O
did O
not O

These O

might O
indicate O
that O
the O

plays O
a O

BACKGROUND: O
A O
previous O
randomized O
controlled O
trial O
evaluating O
the O
use O
of O
spironolactone O
in O
heart B
failure I
patients O
reported O
a O
low O
risk O
of O
hyperkalemia B
(2%) O
and O
renal B
insufficiency I
(0%). O
Because O
treatments O
for O
heart O
failure O
have O
changed O
since O
the O
benefits O
of O
spironolactone O
were O
reported, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
these O
complications O
may O
differ O
in O
current O
clinical O
practice. O
We O
therefore O
sought O
to O
determine O
the O
prevalence O
and O
clinical O
associations O
of O
hyperkalemia O
and O
renal O
insufficiency O
in O
heart O
failure O
patients O
treated O
with O
spironolactone. O
METHODS: O
We O
performed O
a O
case O
control O
study O
of O
heart O
failure O
patients O
treated O
with O
spironolactone O
in O
our O
clinical O
practice. O
Cases O
were O
patients O
who O
developed O
hyperkalemia O
(K(+) O
>5.0 O
mEq/L) O
or O
renal O
insufficiency O
(Cr O
>or=2.5 O
mg/dL), O
and O
they O
were O
compared O
to O
2 O
randomly O
selected O
controls O
per O
case. O
Clinical O
characteristics, O
medications, O
and O
serum O
chemistries O
at O
baseline O
and O
follow-up O
time O
periods O
were O
compared. O
RESULTS: O
Sixty-seven O
of O
926 O
patients O
(7.2%) O
required O
discontinuation O
of O
spironolactone O
due O
to O
hyperkalemia O
(n O
= O
33) O
or O
renal B
failure I
(n O
= O
34). O
Patients O
who O
developed O
hyperkalemia O
were O
older O
and O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
diabetes, B
had O
higher O
baseline O
serum O
potassium O
levels O
and O
lower O
baseline O
potassium O
supplement O
doses, O
and O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
beta-blockers O
than O
controls O
(n O
= O
134). O
Patients O
who O
developed O
renal O
insufficiency O
had O
lower O
baseline O
body O
weight O
and O
higher O
baseline O
serum O
creatinine, O
required O
higher O
doses O
of O
loop O
diuretics, O
and O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
thiazide O
diuretics O
than O
controls. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Spironolactone-induced O
hyperkalemia O
and O
renal O
insufficiency O
are O
more O
common O
in O
our O
clinical O
experience O
than O
reported O
previously. O
This O
difference O
is O
explained O
by O
patient O
comorbidities O
and O
more O
frequent O
use O
of O
beta-blockers. O

a O
serious O
health O
problem O
and, O
as O
their O
ototoxic O
mechanism O

we O
need O
to O
assess O
the O
use O
of O
NO O
inhibitors O
for O
the O
prevention O
of O
aminoglycoside-induced O

In O
this O
experimental O
study O
we O
used O
30 O
Sprague-Dawley O
rats, O
27 O
of O
which O
had O
gentamicin O
instilled O
into O
the O
middle O

The O
otoprotectant O
L-NAME O
was O
administered O

animals. O
Its O
effect O
was O
determined O
in O

of O
attenuation O
of O

measured O
by O
shifts O
in O
the O

L-NAME O
reduced O
gentamicin-induced O

high-frequency O
range, O
but O
gave O
no O

2. O
The O
potential O
of O

evaluated O
by O

Four O

On O
the O
basis O
that O
only O

will O
elicit O
a O

and O
data O
on O
the O

were O
obtained O
for O
these O

3. O
These O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O

E4031 O
(1.9 O

closely O
correlate O
with O
the O

For O
compounds O
that O
have O
shown O
TDP O
in O
the O
clinic O
(terfenadine, O
terodiline, O
cisapride) O
there O
is O
little O
differentiation O
between O
the O

and O
the O
efficacious O
free O
plasma O
concentrations O
in O
man O
(< O
10-fold) O
reflecting O
their O

margins. O
These O
data O
underline O
the O
need O
to O
maximize O
the O
therapeutic O
ratio O
with O
respect O
to O
TDP O
in O

A O
few O
minutes O
after O

of O
the O
drugs, O
they O
presented O
urticaria B
(patients O
1 O
and O
2) O
and O
conjunctivitis B
(patient O
1). O
The O
purpose O
of O
our O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
patients' O
reactions, O
the O
immunological O
mechanisms O
involved O
and O
whether O
these O
patients O
would O
be O
able O
to O
tolerate O
any O
kind O
of O
corticoid. O
Clinical O
examinations O
and O
skin, O
oral O
and O
parenteral O
challenges O
with O
different O
corticosteroids O
and O
ELISA O
tests O
were O
performed. O
In O
the O
two O
patients, O
skin O
and O
ELISA O
tests O
with O
paramethasone O
were O
negative, O
as O
was O
the O
prick O
test O
with O
each O
of O
its O
excipients. O
A O
single-blind O
parenteral O
challenge O
with O
Triniol O
was O
positive O
in O
both O
patients O
after O
the O
administration O
of O
1 O
ml O
of O
the O
drug, O
and O
negative O
with O
its O
excipients. O
We O
also O
carried O
out O
oral O
and O
parenteral O
challenges O
with O
other O
corticosteroids O
and O
found O
intolerance O
to O
some O
of O
them. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
paramethasone O
caused O
pseudoallergic O
reactions O
in O
our O
patients. O
Corticosteroids O
different O
from O
paramethasone O
also O
produced O
hypersensitivity B
reactions O
in O
these O
patients; O
however, O
a O
few O
of O
them O
were O
tolerated. O
The O
basic O
mechanisms O
of O
those O
reactions O
are O
not O
yet O
fully O
understood. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
report O
of O
a O

BACKGROUND: O
Inhibition O
of O
cardiac O
sympathetic O
tone O
represents O
an O
important O
strategy O
for O
treatment O
of O
cardiovascular B
disease, I
including O
arrhythmia, B

disease, I
and O
chronic O
heart B
failure. I
Activation O
of O
presynaptic O
alpha2-adrenoceptors O
is O
the O
most O
widely O
accepted O
mechanism O
of O
action O
of O
the O
antisympathetic O
drug O
clonidine; O
however, O
other O
target O
proteins O
have O
been O
postulated O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
in O
vivo O
actions O
of O
clonidine. O
METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
To O
test O
whether O
clonidine O
elicits O
pharmacological O
effects O
independent O
of O
alpha2-adrenoceptors, O
we O
have O
generated O
mice O
with O
a O
targeted O
deletion O
of O
all O
3 O
alpha2-adrenoceptor O
subtypes O
(alpha2ABC-/-). O
Alpha2ABC-/- O
mice O
were O
completely O
unresponsive O
to O
the O
analgesic O
and O
hypnotic O
effects O
of O
clonidine; O
however, O
clonidine O
significantly O
lowered O
heart O
rate O
in O
alpha2ABC-/- O
mice O
by O
up O
to O
150 O
bpm. O
Clonidine-induced O
bradycardia B
in O
conscious O
alpha2ABC-/- O
mice O
was O
32.3% O
(10 O
microg/kg) O
and O
26.6% O
(100 O
microg/kg) O
of O
the O
effect O
in O
wild-type O
mice. O
A O
similar O
bradycardic O
effect O
of O
clonidine O
was O
observed O
in O
isolated O
spontaneously O
beating O
right O
atria O
from O
alpha2ABC-knockout O
and O
wild-type O
mice. O
Clonidine O
inhibited O
the O
native O
pacemaker O
current O
(I(f)) O
in O
isolated O
sinoatrial O
node O
pacemaker O
cells O
and O
the O
I(f)-generating O
hyperpolarization-activated O
cyclic O
nucleotide-gated O
(HCN) O
2 O
and O
HCN4 O
channels O
in O
transfected O
HEK293 O
cells. O
As O
a O
consequence O
of O
blocking O
I(f), O
clonidine O
reduced O
the O
slope O
of O
the O
diastolic O
depolarization O
and O
the O
frequency O
of O
pacemaker O
potentials O
in O
sinoatrial O
node O

from O
wild-type O
and O
alpha2ABC-knockout O
mice. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Direct O
inhibition O
of O
cardiac O
HCN O
pacemaker O
channels O
contributes O
to O
the O
bradycardic O
effects O
of O
clonidine O
gene-targeted O
mice O
in O
vivo, O
and O
thus, O
clonidine-like O
drugs O
represent O
novel O
structures O
for O
future O
HCN O
channel O
inhibitors. O

In O
the O
cardiovascular O
system, O
NO O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
a O
variety O
of O

Inhibition O
of O
NO O

induces O
sustained O
hypertension. B
In O
several O
models O
of O
hypertension, O
elevation O
of O
intracellular O
sodium O
level O
was O
documented O
in O
cardiac O
tissue. O
To O
assess O
the O
molecular O
basis O
of O
disturbances O
in O
transmembraneous O
transport O
of O
Na+, O
we O
studied O
the O
response O
of O
cardiac O
(Na,K)-ATPase O
to O
NO-deficient O
hypertension O
induced O
in O
rats O
by O
NO-synthase O

with O
40 O
mg/kg/day O
N(G)-nitro-L-arginine O
methyl O
ester O
(L-NAME) O
for O
4 O
four O
weeks. O
After O
4-week O
administration O
of O
L-NAME, O
the O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
(SBP) O
increased O
by O
36%. O
Two O
weeks O
after O
terminating O
the O
treatment, O
the O
SBP O
recovered O
to O
control O
value. O
When O
activating O
the O
(Na,K)-ATPase O
with O
its O
substrate O
ATP, O
no O
changes O
in O
Km O
and O
Vmax O
values O
were O
observed O
in O
NO-deficient O
rats. O
During O
activation O
with O
Na+, O
the O
Vmax O
remained O
unchanged, O
however O
the O
K(Na) O
increased O
by O
50%, O
indicating O
a O
profound O
decrease O
in O
the O
affinity O
of O
the O
Na+-binding O
site O
in O
NO-deficient O
rats. O
After O
recovery O
from O
hypertension, O
the O
activity O
of O
(Na,K)-ATPase O
increased, O
due O
to O
higher O
affinity O
of O
the O
ATP-binding O
site, O
as O
revealed O
from O
the O
lowered O
Km O
value O
for O
ATP. O
The O
K(Na) O
value O
for O
Na+ O
returned O
to O
control O
value. O
Inhibition O
of O
NO-synthase O
induced O
a O
reversible O
hypertension O
accompanied O
by O
depressed B
Na+-extrusion O
from O
cardiac O
cells O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
deteriorated O
Na+-binding O
properties O
of O
the O
(Na,K)-ATPase. O
After O
recovery O
of O
blood O
pressure O
to O
control O
values, O
the O
extrusion O
of O
Na+ O
from O
cardiac O
cells O
was O
normalized, O
as O
revealed O
by O
restoration O
of O
the O

to O
investigate O
whether O

so O
that O
we O
can O
develop O

METHODS: O
3-methyladenine O
(3MA), O
a O
specific O
inhibitor O
on O

was O
used O
in O
a O
heart O

randomly O
divided O
into O
controls, O
an O
adriamycin-treated O
group, O
and O
a O

group. O
We O
then O
examined O
the O

mitochondrial O
permeability O
transition O
(MPT), O
and O
Na+-K+ O

We O
also O
assessed O

and O
counted O
autophagic O

we O
analyzed O
the O

using O
RT-PCR O
and O

in O
an O
animal O
model. O
RESULTS: O
3MA O
significantly O
improved O
cardiac O
function O
and O
reduced O
mitochondrial O
injury. O
Furthermore, O
adriamycin O
induced O
the O
formation O
of O
autophagic O
vacuoles, O
and O
3MA O
strongly O
downregulated O
the O
expression O

this O
is O
the O

Our O

RESULTS: O
During O
a O
mean O

METHODS: O
We O
used O
computerized O
pharmacy O
records O
to O
identify O
all O
adult O
psychiatric B
inpatients O
treated O
with O
clozapine O
(1995-96), O
reviewed O
their O
medical O
records O
to O
score O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
delirium, O
and O
tested O
associations O
with O
potential O
risk O
factors. O
RESULTS: O
Subjects O
(n O

were O
72 O
women O
and O
67 O
men, O
aged O
40.8 O
+/- O
12.1 O
years, O
hospitalized O
for O
24.9 O
+/- O
23.3 O

203 O
mg O
(3.45 O
+/- O
2.45 O

Delirium B
was O
diagnosed O
in O
14 O
(10.1 O
% O

or O
1.48 O
cases/person-years O
of O
exposure); O
71.4 O
% O
of O
cases O
were O
moderate O
or O
severe. O
Associated O
factors O
were O
co-treatment O
with O
other O
centrally O
antimuscarinic O
agents, O
poor O
clinical O
outcome, O
older O
age, O
and O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Delirium O
was O
found O
in O
10 O
% O
of O
clozapine-treated O
inpatients, O
particularly O
in O
older O
patients O
exposed O

were O
tested O
for O
susceptibility O

induced O
by O
a O

Cocaine O
was O
injected O

(50-100 O
mg/kg) O
and O
behavior O
was O
monitored O
for O

the O

Brain O
MR O

were O
prospectively O
performed O
in O
14 O

In O
each O
patient O
who O
had O
abnormalities O
on O
the O
initial O
MR O
study, O
a O
follow-up O
MR O
study O
was O
performed O
1 O
month O
later. O
Apparent O

coefficient O
(ADC) O
values O
on O
the O
initial O
MR O
study O
were O
correlated O
with O
reversibility O
of O
the O

Of O
the O
14 O
patients, O
5 O
(35.7%) O
had O
white B

abnormalities, I
1 O
(7.1%) O
had O
putaminal B
hemorrhage, I
and O
8 O
(57.1%) O
had O

Among O
the O
5 O
patients O
with O

4 O
patients O
(80.0%) O
showed O
higher O
than O
normal O
ADC O
values O
on O
initial O

and O
all O
showed O

The O
remaining O
1 O

(20.0%) O
showed O
lower O
than O
normal O
ADC O
value O
and O
showed O
incomplete O

We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
severe O
citrate O
toxicity B
during O
volunteer O
donor O
apheresis O
platelet O
collection. O
The O
donor O
was O
a O
40-year-old O
female, O
first-time O
apheresis O
platelet O
donor. O
Past O
medical O
history O
was O
remarkable O
for O
hypertension, B
hyperlipidemia, B
and O
depression. B
Reported O
medications O
included O
bumetanide, O
pravastatin, O
and O
paroxetine. O
Thirty O
minutes O
from O
the O
start O
of O
the O
procedure, O
the O
donor O
noted O
tingling O
around O
the O
mouth, O
hands, O
and O
feet. O
She O
then O
very O
rapidly O
developed O
acute O
onset O
of O
severe O
facial O
and O
extremity O
tetany. B
Empirical O
treatment O
with O
intravenous O
calcium O
gluconate O
was O
initiated, O
and O
muscle B
contractions I
slowly O
subsided O
over O
approximately O
10 O
to O
15 O
minutes. O
The O
events O
are O
consistent O
with O
a O
severe O
reaction O
to O
calcium O
chelation O
by O
sodium O
citrate O
anticoagulant O
resulting O
in O
symptomatic O
systemic O
hypocalcemia. B
Upon O
additional O
retrospective O
analysis, O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
bumetanide O
is O
a O
loop O
diuretic O
that O
may O
cause O
significant O
hypocalcemia. O
We O
conclude O
that O
careful O
screening O
for O
medications O
and O
underlying O
conditions O
predisposing O
to O
hypocalcemia O
is O
recommended O
to O
help O
prevent O
severe O
reactions O
due O
to O
citrate O
toxicity. O
Laboratory O
measurement O
of O
pre-procedure O
serum O
calcium O
levels O
in O
selected O

may O
identify O
cases O
requiring O
heightened O
vigilance. O
The O
case O
also O
illustrates O
the O
importance O
of O
maintaining O
preparedness O
for O
managing O
rare O
but O
serious O
reactions O
in O

enalapril O
a O
multicenter, O

designed O
that O

the O

severity O
of O
symptomatic O

on O
the O

Trial O
medication O
was O
2.5 O

were O
1210 O

Patients O
who O

enalapril O
experienced O
clinically O
and O
statistically O
significantly O
less O

(5.2%) O
than O
the O
patients O
who O
received O

(12.9%). O
All O

recovered. O
It O
was O
concluded O
that O

was O
well O

and O
it O
is, O
therefore, O
unreasonable O
to O
restrict O
the O
initiation O
of O
treatment O
with O
enalapril O
to O
inpatients. O

We O

of O
a O
patient O
in O
whom O
troleandomycin-induced O
hepatitis B
was O
followed O
by O
prolonged O

Jaundice B
occurred O
after O
administration O
of O
troleandomycin O
for O
7 O
days O
and O
was O
associated O
with O
hypereosinophilia. B
Jaundice O
disappeared O
within O
3 O
months O
but O
was O
followed O
by O
prolonged O

cholestasis O
marked O
by O
pruritus B
and O
high O

Finally, O

months, O
and O

returned O
to O
normal O
27 O
months O
after O
the O

This O
observation O
demonstrates O
that O

can O
follow O
troleandomycin-induced O

In O
this O
study, O
three O
Chinese O
patients O
with O
ticlopidine-induced O
aplastic B
anemia I
were O
reported O
and O
another O
13 O
patients O
in O
the O
English O
literature O
were O
reviewed. O
We O
attempted O
to O
find O
underlying O
similarities, O
evaluate O
the O
risk O
factors, O
and O
identify O
appropriate O
treatment O
for O
this O
complication. O
All O
but O
one O
of O
the O
patients O
were O
over O
60 O
years O
old, O
and O
the O
6 O
who O
died O
were O
all O
older O
than O
65. O
Therefore, O
old O
age O
may O
be O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
developing O
this O
complication. O
Agranulocytosis B
occurred O
3-20 O
weeks O
after O
initiation O
of O
ticlopidine, O
so O
frequent O
examination O
of O
white O
cell O
count O
during O
treatment O
is O
recommended. O
There O
seemed O
to O
be O
no O
direct O
correlation O
between O
the O
dose O
or O
duration O
used O
and O
the O
severity O
of O
bone B

suppression. I
Treatment O
for O
ticlopidine-induced O
aplastic O
anemia O
with O
colony-stimulating O
factors O
seemed O
to O
have O
little O
effect. O
The O
fact O
that O
5 O
of O
the O
6 O
patients O
who O
received O
concurrent O
calcium O
channel O

died, O
should O
alert O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
OBJECTIVE: O
Despite O
advantages O
of O
induction O
and O
maintenance O
of O
anaesthesia O
with O
sevoflurane, O
postoperative B
nausea I
and I
vomiting I
occurs O
frequently. O
Fentanyl O
is O
a O
commonly O
used O
supplement O
that O
may O
contribute O
to O
this, O
although O
it O
may O
also O
improve O
analgesia. O
METHODS: O
This O
double-blind O
study O
examined O
the O
incidence O
and O
severity O
of O
postoperative O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
and O
pain B
in O
the O
first O
24 O
h O
after O
sevoflurane O
anaesthesia O
in O
216 O
adult O
day O
surgery O
patients. O
Patients O
were O
randomly O
allocated O
to O
either O
receive O
or O
not O
receive O
1 O
1 O
fentanyl, O
while O
a O
third O
group O
received O
dexamethasone O
in O
addition O
to O
fentanyl. O
RESULTS: O
Omission O
of O
fentanyl O
did O
not O
reduce O
the O
overall O
incidence O
of O
postoperative O
nausea O
and O
vomiting, O
but O
did O
reduce O
the O
incidence O
of O
vomiting O
and/or O
moderate O
to O
severe O
nausea O
prior O
to O
discharge O
from O
20% O
and O
17% O
with O
fentanyl O
and O
fentanyl-dexamethasone, O
respectively, O
to O
5% O
(P O
= O
0.013). O
Antiemetic O
requirements O
were O
reduced O
from O
24% O
and O
31% O
to O
7% O
(P O
= O
0.0012). O
Dexamethasone O
had O
no O
significant O
effect O
on O
the O
incidence O
or O
severity O
of O
postoperative O
nausea O
and O
vomiting. O
Combining O
the O
two O
fentanyl O
groups O
revealed O
further O
significant O
benefits O
from O
the O
avoidance O
of O
opioids, O
reducing O
postoperative O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
and O
nausea O
prior O
to O
discharge O
from O
35% O
and O
33% O
to O
22% O
and O
19% O
(P O
= O
0.049 O
and O
P O
= O
0.035), O
respectively, O
while O
nausea O
in O
the O
first O
24 O
h O
was O
decreased O
from O
42% O
to O
27% O
(P O
= O
0.034). O
Pain B
severity O
and O
analgesic O
requirements O
were O
unaffected O
by O
the O
omission O
of O
fentanyl. O
Fentanyl O
did O
reduce O
minor O
intraoperative O
movement O
but O
had O
no O
sevoflurane-sparing O
effect O
and O
increased O
respiratory B
depression, I
hypotension B
and O
bradycardia. B
CONCLUSION: O
As O
fentanyl O
exacerbated O
postoperative O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
without O
an O
improvement O
in O
postoperative B
pain I
and O
also O
had O
adverse O
cardiorespiratory O
effects, O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
unnecessary O
and O
possibly O
detrimental O
supplement O
to O
sevoflurane O
in O
day O
surgery. O

Given O

Systemic O

the O

(0.1-10 O

administered O
intra-accumbens O

When O

Our O

RESULTS: O
CsA, O
FK506 O

also O
showed O
the O

Schizophrenia B
has O
been O
initially O
associated O
with O
dysfunction O
in O
dopamine O
neurotransmission. O
However, O
the O
observation O
that O
antagonists O
of O
the O
glutamate O
N-methyl-D-aspartate O
(NMDA) O
receptor O
produce O
schizophrenic-like B
symptoms O
in O
humans O
has O
led O
to O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
dysfunctioning O
of O
the O
glutamatergic O
system O
via O
its O
NMDA O
receptor. O
As O
a O
result, O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
interest O
in O
the O
development O
of O
pharmacological O
agents O
with O
potential O
antipsychotic O
properties O
that O
enhance O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
glutamatergic O
system O
via O
a O
modulation O
of O
the O
NMDA O
receptor. O
Among O
them O
are O
glycine O
transporter-1 O
(GlyT1) O
inhibitors O
such O
as O
SSR103800, O
which O
indirectly O
enhance O
NMDA O
receptor O
function O
by O
increasing O
the O
glycine O
(a O
co-agonist O
for O
the O
NMDA O
receptor) O
levels O
in O
the O
synapse. O
This O
study O
aimed O
at O
investigating O
the O
potential O
antipsychotic-like O
properties O
of O
SSR103800, O
with O
a O
particular O
focus O
on O
models O
of O
hyperactivity, B
involving O
either O
drug O
challenge O
(ie, O
amphetamine O
and O
MK-801) O
or O
transgenic O
mice O
(ie, O
NMDA O
Nr1(neo-/-) O
and O
DAT(-/-)). O
Results O
showed O
that O
SSR103800 O
(10-30 O
mg/kg O
p.o.) O
blocked O
hyperactivity O
induced O
by O
the O
non-competitive O
NMDA O
receptor O
antagonist, O
MK-801 O
and O
partially O
reversed O
spontaneous O
hyperactivity O
of O
NMDA O
Nr1(neo-/-) O
mice. O
In O
contrast, O
SSR103800 O
failed O
to O
affect O
hyperactivity O
induced O
by O
amphetamine O
or O
naturally O
observed O
in O
dopamine O
transporter O
(DAT(-/-)) O
knockout O
mice O
(10-30 O
mg/kg O
p.o.). O
Importantly, O
both O
classical O
(haloperidol) O
and O
atypical O
(olanzapine, O
clozapine O
and O
aripiprazole) O
antipsychotics O
were O
effective O
in O
all O
these O
models O
of O
hyperactivity. O
However, O
unlike O
these O
latter, O
SSR103800 O
did O
not O
produce O
catalepsy B
(retention O
on O
the O
bar O
test) O
up O
to O
30 O
mg/kg O
p.o. O
Together O
these O
findings O
show O
that O
the O
GlyT1 O
inhibitor, O
SSR103800, O
produces O
antipsychotic-like O
effects, O
which O
differ O
from O
those O
observed O
with O
compounds O
primarily O
targeting O
the O
dopaminergic O
system, O
and O
has O
a O
reduced O
side-effect O
potential O
as O
compared O
with O
these O
latter O
drugs. O

Introduction O
of O
the O
DSM-IV O
diagnosis O
of O
CIMD O
did O
not O
substantially O
affect O
rates O

Patients O
with O
CIMD O
had O
symptom O

between O
those O
of O
patients O
with O
and O
without O
a O
mood O
disorder. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
some O
validity O
for O
the O
new O
DSM-IV O
diagnosis O
of O
CIMD, O
but O
also O
suggest O
that O
it O
requires O
further O
specification O
and O
replication. O

INTRODUCTION: O
Intoxications O
with O
carbachol, O
a O
muscarinic O
cholinergic O
receptor O
agonist O
are O
rare. O
We O
report O
an O
interesting O
case O
investigating O
a O
(near) O
fatal O
poisoning. B
METHODS: O
The O
son O
of O
an O
84-year-old O
male O
discovered O
a O
newspaper O
report O
stating O
clinical O
success O
with O
plant O
extracts O
in O
Alzheimer's B
disease. I
The O
mode O
of O
action O
was O
said O
to O
be O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
the O
synthetic O
compound O
'carbamylcholin'; O
that O
is, O
carbachol. O
He O
bought O
25 O
g O
of O
carbachol O
as O
pure O
substance O
in O
a O
pharmacy, O
and O
the O
father O
was O
administered O
400 O
to O
500 O
mg. O
Carbachol O
concentrations O
in O
serum O
and O
urine O
on O
day O
1 O
and O
2 O
of O
hospital O
admission O
were O
analysed O
by O
HPLC-mass O
spectrometry. O
RESULTS: O
Minutes O
after O
oral O
administration, O
the O
patient O
developed O
nausea, B
sweating O
and O
hypotension, B
and O
finally O
collapsed. O
Bradycardia, B
cholinergic O
symptoms O
and O
asystole B
occurred. O
Initial O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
and O
immediate O
treatment O
with O
adrenaline O
(epinephrine), O
atropine O
and O
furosemide O
was O
successful. O
On O
hospital O
admission, O
blood O
pressure O
of O
the O
intubated, O
bradyarrhythmic O
patient O
was O
100/65 O
mmHg. O
Further O
signs O
were O
hyperhidrosis, B
hypersalivation, B
bronchorrhoea, B
and O
severe O
miosis; B
the O
electrocardiographic O
finding O
was O
atrio-ventricular B
dissociation. I
High O
doses O
of O
atropine O
(up O
to O
50 O
mg O
per O
24 O
hours), O
adrenaline O
and O
dopamine O
were O
necessary. O
The O
patient O
was O
extubated O
1 O
week O
later. O
However, O
increased O
dyspnoea B
and O
bronchospasm B
necessitated O
reintubation. O
Respiratory B
insufficiency I
was O
further O
worsened O
by O
Proteus B
mirabilis I
infection I
and O
severe O
bronchoconstriction. O
One O
week O
later, O
the O
patient O
was O
again O
extubated O
and O
3 O
days O
later O
was O
transferred O
to O
a O
peripheral O
ward. O
On O
the O
next O
day O
he O
died, O
probably O
as O
a O
result O
of O
heart B
failure. I
Serum O
samples O
from O
the O
first O
and O
second O
days O
contained O
3.6 O
and O
1.9 O
mg/l O
carbachol, O
respectively. O
The O
corresponding O
urine O
concentrations O
amounted O
to O
374 O
and O
554 O
mg/l. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
case O
started O
with O
a O
media O
report O
in O
a O
popular O
newspaper, O
initiated O
by O
published, O
peer-reviewed O
research O
on O
herbals, O
and O
involved O
human O
failure O
in O
a O
case O
history, O
medical O
examination O
and O
clinical O
treatment. O
For O
the O
first O
time, O
an O
analytical O
method O
for O
the O
determination O
of O
carbachol O
in O
plasma O
and O
urine O
has O
been O
developed. O
The O
analysed O
carbachol O
concentration O
exceeded O
the O
supposed O
serum O
level O
resulting O
from O
a O
therapeutic O
dose O
by O
a O
factor O
of O
130 O
to O
260. O
Especially O
in O
old O
patients, O
intensivists O
should O
consider O
intoxications O
(with O
cholinergics) O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
acute B
cardiovascular I
failure. I

Two O
patients O
developed O
acute B
tubular I
necrosis, I
characterized O
clinically O
by O
acute O
oliguric B
renal B
failure, I
while O
they O
were O
receiving O
a O
combination O
of O
cephalothin O
sodium O
and O
gentamicin O
sulfate O
therapy. O
Patients O
who O
are O
given O
this O
drug O
regimen O
should O
be O
observed O
very O
carefully O
for O
early O
signs O
of O
nephrotoxicity. B
High O
doses O
of O
this O
antibiotic O
combination O
should O
be O
avoided O
especially O
in O
elderly O
patients. O
Patients O
with O
renal B
insufficiency I
should O
not O
be O
given O
this O
regimen. O

The O
correlation O
between O
neuropathic B
damage I
and O
inhibition O
of O
neurotoxic B
esterase O
or O
neuropathy B
target O
enzyme O
(NTE) O
was O
examined O
in O
rats O
acutely O
exposed O
to O
Mipafox O
(N, O
N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate), O
a O
neurotoxic O
organophosphate. O
Brain O
and O
spinal O
cord O
NTE O
activities O
were O
measured O
in O
Long-Evans O
male O
rats O
1 O
hr O
post-exposure O
to O
various O
dosages O
of O
Mipafox O
(ip, O
1-15 O
mg/kg). O
These O
data O
were O
correlated O
with O
histologically O
scored O
cervical O
cord B
damage I
in O
a O
separate O
group O
of O
similarly O
dosed O
rats O
sampled O
14-21 O
days O
post-exposure. O
Those O
dosages O
(greater O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
10 O
mg/kg) O
that O
inhibited O
mean O
NTE O
activity O
in O
the O
spinal O
cord O
greater O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
73% O
and O
brain O
greater O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
67% O
of O
control O
values O
produced O
severe O
(greater O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
3) O
cervical O
cord O
pathology O
in O
85% O
of O
the O
rats. O
In O
contrast, O
dosages O
of O
Mipafox O
(less O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
5 O
mg/kg) O
which O
inhibited O
mean O
NTE O
activity O
in O
spinal O
cord O
less O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
61% O
and O
brain O
less O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
60% O
produced O
this O
degree O
of O
cord O
damage O
in O
only O
9% O
of O
the O
animals. O
These O
data O
indicate O
that O
a O
critical O
percentage O
of O
NTE O
inhibition O
in O
brain O
and O
spinal O
cord O
sampled O
shortly O
after O
Mipafox O
exposure O
can O
predict O
neuropathic O
damage O
in O
rats O
several O
weeks O
later. O

of O
six O
children O
who O
developed O
the O

after O
treatment O
with O
metronidazole. O
These O
children O
were O

were O
more O

are O
other O

While O
the O
involvement O
of O
metronidazole O
in O
the O
aetiology O
of O
the O

is O
not O
established O
firmly, O
the O
action O

to O
oxidation O
injury O
and O
the O
reported O
evidence O
of O
oxidation O

in O
the O
haemolytic-uraemic O

suggest O
a O
possible O
link O
between O
metronidazole O
treatment O
and O
some O
cases O
of O
the O

at O
the O

At O
this O
point O
it O
was O
assumed O
that O
the O
cytochrome O

toxic O
state O
was O
both O
maximal O
and O
stable. O
The O
optimal O
rat O
size O

In O
an O
attempt O
to O
determine O
whether O
penile B
pain I
associated O
with O
intracorporeal O
injections O
could O
be O
due O
to O
the O
acidity O
of O
the O
medication, O
we O
performed O
a O
randomized O
study O
comparing O
the O
incidence O
of O
penile O
pain O
following O
intracorporeal O
injections O
with O
or O
without O
the O
addition O
of O
sodium O
bicarbonate O
to O
the O
intracorporeal O

A O
total O
of O
38 O
consecutive O
patients O
who O
presented O
to O
our O

received O
0.2 O

Of O
the O
19 O

added O
to O
the O
medication O
11 O
(58%) O
complained O

only O
1 O
of O
the O
19 O
men O
(5%) O
who O
received O
sodium O

complained O
of O
penile O

From O
these O
data O
we O
conclude O
that O
the O
penile O
pain O
following O
intracorporeal O
injections O
is O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O

in O
the O
cataleptogenic O

The O
cataleptogenic O

was O
significantly O
reduced O
in O

as O
compared O
with O
control O
rats. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
the O
cataleptogenic O
effect O

haloperidol O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
in O
rats O

that O
noradrenergic O

have O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
manifestation O

reminds O
us O
that O
when O
a O

Azidothymidine O
(AZT)-induced O
anemia B
in O

(fusion O

Although O
interleukin O

(IL-3) O
and O
erythropoietin O
(EPO) O
are O
known O
to O
act O
synergistically O
on O
hematopoietic O
cell O
proliferation O
in O

injection O
of O
IGF-IL-3 O
and O
EPO O
in O
AZT-treated O
mice O
resulted O
in O
a O
reduction O
of O
red O

and O
an O
increase O
of O
plasma O
EPO O
levels O
as O
compared O
to O
animals O
treated O
with O
IGF-IL-3 O
or O

We O
tested O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
antagonistic O
effect O
of O
IL-3 O
and O
EPO O
on O
erythroid O
cells O
may O
be O
mediated O
by O
endothelial O

There O
was O
a O
significant O
reduction O
of O
thymidine O
incorporation O
into O
both O
erythroid O
and O
endothelial O
cells O
in O

from O
the O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
endothelial O

(TD) O
whose B
pathophysiology O
has O
been O
related O
to O

In O
the O

the O
authors O
induced O
orofacial O
dyskinesia O
by O
acute O
reserpine O
and O
subchronic O
haloperidol O
administration O
to O
rats. O
Reserpine O
injection O
(one O
dose O
of O
1 O
mg/kg O
s.c.) O
every O
other O
day O
for O
3 O
days O
caused O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
vacuous O

tongue O
protrusion O
and O
duration O
of O
facial O

compared O
to O
the O

Haloperidol O
administration O
(one O
dose O
of O
12 O
mg/kg O
once O
a O
week O
s.c.) O
for O
4 O
weeks O
caused O
an O

observed O
in O
four O

After O
the O
treatments O
and O
behavioral O
observation, O
glutamate O

analyzed. O
A O

observed O
in O
the O

negatively O
with O
an O

These O

indicate O
that O
early O

In O
the O

neither O

The O

was O
significantly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O

These O

a O
relatively O
low O

OBJECTIVE: O
In O
vitro O
work O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
cinacalcet O
is O
a O
strong O
inhibitor O
of O
cytochrome O
P450 O
isoenzyme O
(CYP) O
2D6. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effect O
of O
cinacalcet O
on O
CYP2D6 O
activity, O
using O
desipramine O
as O
a O
probe O
substrate, O
in O
healthy O
subjects. O
METHODS: O
Seventeen O
subjects O
who O
were O
genotyped O
as O
CYP2D6 O
extensive O
metabolizers O
were O
enrolled O
in O
this O
randomized, O
open-label, O
crossover O
study O
to O
receive O
a O
single O
oral O
dose O
of O
desipramine O
(50 O
mg) O
on O
two O
separate O
occasions, O
once O
alone O
and O
once O
after O
multiple O
doses O
of O
cinacalcet O
(90 O
mg O
for O
7 O
days). O
Blood O
samples O
were O
obtained O
predose O
and O
up O
to O
72 O
h O
postdose. O
RESULTS: O
Fourteen O
subjects O
completed O
both O
treatment O
arms. O
Relative O
to O
desipramine O
alone, O
mean O
AUC O
and O
C(max) O
of O
desipramine O
increased O
3.6- O
and O
1.8-fold O
when O
coadministered O
with O
cinacalcet. O
The O
t O
(1/2,z) O
of O
desipramine O
was O
longer O
when O
desipramine O
was O
coadministered O
with O
cinacalcet O
(21.0 O
versus O
43.3 O
hs). O
The O
t O
(max) O
was O
similar O
between O
the O
regimens. O
Fewer O
subjects O
reported O
adverse O
events O
following O
treatment O
with O
desipramine O
alone O
than O
when O
receiving O
desipramine O
with O
cinacalcet O
(33 O
versus O
86%), O
the O
most O
frequent O
of O
which O
(nausea O
and B
headache) B
have O
been O
reported O
for O
patients O
treated O
with O
either O
desipramine O
or O
cinacalcet. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
cinacalcet O
is O
a O
strong O
inhibitor O
of O
CYP2D6. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
during O
concomitant O
treatment O
with O
cinacalcet, O
dose O
adjustment O
may O
be O
necessary O
for O
drugs O
that O
demonstrate O
a O
narrow O
therapeutic O
index O
and O
are O
metabolized O
by O
CYP2D6. O

The O

was O
compared O
between O
five O
patients O
receiving O
a O

(mean O
73.6 O

and O
five O

receiving O
a O

of O
0.25% O
bupivacaine O
(mean O
192 O
mg) O
in O
the O
24-h O
period O
following O

Monitoring O
consisted O
of O

detected O
by O
pneumatic O

and O
continuous O
electrocardiograph O
recorded O
with O
a O

monitor. O
Both O
obstructive B
(P I
less I
than I
0.05) I
and I
central B
apnoea I
(P O
less O
than O
0.05) O
occurred O
more O
frequently O
in O
patients O
who O
had O
a O
morphine O
infusion. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
tachyarrhythmias B
(P O
less O
than O
0.05) O
and O

The O
half-life O
(t1/2) O
of O
cocaine O
is O
relatively O
short, O
but O
some O
of O
the O
consequences O
of O
its O
use, O
such O
as O
seizures B
and O
strokes, B
can O
occur O
hours O
after O
exposure. O
This O
led O
us O
to O
hypothesize O
that O
a O
metabolite O
of O
cocaine O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
some O
of O
those O
delayed O
sequelae. O
We O
evaluated O
the O
potential O
of O
the O
major O
metabolite O
of O
cocaine, O
benzoylecgonine O
(BE), O
to O
cause O
seizures. O
Two O
separate O
equimolar O
doses O
(0.2 O
and O
0.4 O
mumol) O
of O
either O
cocaine O
or O
BE O
were O
injected O
ventricularly O
in O
unanesthetized O
juvenile O
rats. O
Treated O
rats O
were O
then O
evaluated O
for O
incidence, O
latency, O
and O
seizure O
pattern O
or O
for O
locomotor O
activity O
in O
animals O
without O
seizures. O
BE-Induced O
seizures O
occurred O
more O
frequently O
and O
had O
significantly O
longer O
latencies O
than O
those O
induced O
by O
equimolar O
amounts O
of O
cocaine. O
Whereas O
cocaine-induced O
seizures O
were O
best O
characterized O
as O
brief, O
generalized, O
and O
tonic O
and O
resulted O
in O
death, B
those O
induced O
by O
BE O
were O
prolonged, O
often O
multiple O
and O
mixed O
in O
type, O
and O
rarely O
resulted O
in O
death. O
Electrical O
recordings O
from O
the O
hippocampus O
showed O
a O
rhythmic O
progression O
in O
EEG O
frequency O
and O
voltage O
with O
clinical O
seizure O
expression. O
BE-Injected O
rats O
that O
did O
not O
have O
seizures O
had O
significantly O
more O
locomotor O
activity O
than O
cocaine-injected O
animals O
without O
seizures. O
The O
finding O
that O
cocaine- O
and O
BE-induced O
seizures O
differ O
in O
several O
respects O
suggests O
more O
than O
one O
mechanism O
for O
cocaine-induced O
seizures O
and O
emphasizes O
the O
importance O
of O
a O
cocaine O
metabolite, O
BE. O

A O
54-year-old O
hypothyroid B
male O
taking O
thyroxine O
and O

presented O
with O
bilateral O

Urgent O
fasciotomies O
were O
performed O
and O
the O
patient O
made O
an O
uneventful O
recovery O
with O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
simvastatin. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
this O
complication O
will O
be O
seen O
more O
often O
with O
the O
increased O
worldwide O
use O
of O
this O

PURPOSE: O
We O
reviewed O
the O
results O
of O
serum O
testosterone O
and O
prolactin O
determination O
in O
1,022 O
patients O
referred O
because O
of O
erectile B

and O
compared O
the O
data O
with O
history, O
results O
of O
physical O
examination, O
other O
etiological O
investigations O
and O
effects O
of O
endocrine O

to O
refine O
the O
rules O
of O
cost-effective O
endocrine O

and O
to O
pinpoint O
actual O

for O
hormonal O
abnormalities. O
MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
Testosterone O
and O
prolactin O
were O
determined O
by O
radioimmunoassay. O
Every O
patient O
was O
screened O
for O
testosterone O
and O
451 O
were O
screened O
for O
prolactin O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
low B
sexual I
desire, I
gynecomastia B
or O
testosterone O
less O
than O
4 O
ng./ml. O
Determination O
was O
repeated O
in O
case O
of O
abnormal O
first O
results. O
Prolactin O
results O
were O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
a O
previous O
personal O
cohort O
of O
1,340 O
patients O
with O
erectile O
dysfunction O
and O
systematic O
prolactin O
determination. O
Main O
clinical O
criteria O
tested O
regarding O
efficiency O
in O
hormone O
determination O
were O
low O
sexual O
desire, O
small O
testes O
and O
gynecomastia. O
Endocrine O
therapy O
consisted O
of O
testosterone O
heptylate O
or O
human O
chorionic O
gonadotropin O
for O
hypogonadism B
and O
bromocriptine O
for O
hyperprolactinemia. B
RESULTS: O
Testosterone O
was O
less O
than O
3 O
ng./ml. O
in O
107 O
patients O
but O
normal O
in O
40% O
at O
repeat O
determination. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
repeatedly O
low O
testosterone O
increased O
with O
age O
(4% O
before O
age O
50 O
years O
and O
9% O
50 O
years O
or O
older). O
Two O
pituitary B
tumors I
were O
discovered O
after O
testosterone O
determination. O
Most O
of O
the O
other O
low O
testosterone O
levels O
seemed O
to O
result O
from O
nonorganic O
hypothalamic B
dysfunction I
because O
of O
normal O
serum O
luteinizing O
hormone O
and O
prolactin O
and O
to O
have O
only O
a O
small O
role O
in O
erectile O
dysfunction O
(definite O
improvement O
in O
only O
16 O
of O
44 O
[36%] O
after O
androgen O
therapy, O
normal O
morning O
or O
nocturnal O
erections O
in O
30% O
and O
definite O
vasculogenic O
contributions O
in O
42%). O
Determining O
testosterone O
only O
in O
cases O
of O
low O
sexual O
desire O
or O
abnormal O
physical O
examination O
would O
have O
missed O
40% O
of O
the O
cases O
with O
low O
testosterone, O
including O
37% O
of O
those O
subsequently O
improved O
by O
androgen O
therapy. O
Prolactin O
exceeded O
20 O
ng./ml. O
in O
5 O
men O
and O
was O
normal O
in O
2 O
at O
repeat O
determination. O
Only O
1 O
prolactinoma B
was O
discovered. O
These O
data O
are O
lower O
than O
those O
we O
found O
during O
the O
last O
2 O
decades O
(overall O
prolactin O
greater O
than O
20 O
ng./ml. O
in O
1.86% O
of O
1,821 O
patients, O
prolactinomas B
in O
7, O
0.38%). O
Bromocriptine O
was O
definitely O
effective O
in O
cases O
with O
prolactin O
greater O
than O
35 O
ng./ml. O
(8 O
of O
12 O
compared O
to O
only O
9 O
of O
22 O
cases O
with O
prolactin O
between O
20 O
and O
35 O
ng./ml.). O
Testosterone O
was O
low O
in O
less O
than O
50% O
of O
cases O
with O
prolactin O
greater O
than O
35 O
ng./ml. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Low O
prevalences O
and O
effects O
of O
low O
testosterone O
and O
high O
prolactin O
in O
erectile O
dysfunction O
cannot O
justify O
their O
routine O
determination. O
However, O
cost-effective O
screening O
strategies O
recommended O
so O
far O
missed O
40 O
to O
50% O
of O
cases O
improved O
with O
endocrine O
therapy O
and O
the O
pituitary O
tumors. O
We O
now O
advocate O
that O
before O
age O
50 O
years O
testosterone O
be O
determined O
only O
in O
cases O
of O
low O
sexual O
desire O
and O
abnormal O
physical O
examination O
but O
that O
it O
be O
measured O
in O
all O
men O
older O
than O
50 O
years. O
Prolactin O
should O
be O
determined O
only O
in O
cases O
of O
low O
sexual O
desire, O
gynecomastia O
and/or O
testosterone O
less O
than O
4 O

decreased O
significantly O
compared O
with O
preinfusion O

and O
the O
degree O

PGE1 O
remained O
constant O
until O
60 O

EBFF O
did O
not O

be O
preferable O
to O

Advances O
in O
the O
field O
of O
transplantation O
provide O
a O
better O
quality O
of O
life O
and O
allow O
more O
favorable O
conditions O
for O
growth O
and O
development O
in O
children. O
However, O
combinations O
of O
different O
therapeutic O
regimens O
require O
consideration O
of O
potential O
adverse O
reactions. O
We O
describe O
a O
15-yr-old O
girl O
who O
had O
orthotopic O
liver O
transplantation O
because O
of O
Wilson's B
disease. I
Tacrolimus, O
MMF, O
and O
steroids O
were O
given O
as O
immunosuppressant. O
Lamivudine O
was O
added O
because O
of O
de O
nova O
hepatitis B
B I
infection I
during O
her O
follow-up. O
Three O
yr O
after O
transplantation O
she O
developed O
renal B
Fanconi B
syndrome I
with O
severe O
metabolic B
acidosis, B
hypophosphatemia, B
glycosuria, B
and O
aminoaciduria. B
Although O
tacrolimus O
was O
suspected O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
late O
post-transplant O
renal O
acidosis O
and O
was O
replaced O
by O
sirolimus, O
acidosis, O
and O
electrolyte O
imbalance O
got O
worse. O
Proximal O
muscle B
weakness I
has O
developed O
during O
her O
follow-up. O
Fanconi O
syndrome, O
as O
well O
as O
myopathy, B
is O
well O
recognized O
in O
patients O
with O
mitochondrial B
disorders I
and O
caused O
by O
depletion O
of O
mtDNA. O
We O
suggest O
that O
our O
patient's O
tubular B
dysfunction I
and O
myopathy O
may O
have O
resulted O
from O
mitochondrial B
dysfunction I
which O
is O
triggered O
by O
tacrolimus O
and O
augmented O
by O
lamivudine. O

OBJECTIVE: O
The O
globus O
pallidus O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
movement O
regulation. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
globus O
pallidus O
receives O
neurotensinergic O
innervation O
from O
the O
striatum, O
and O
systemic O
administration O
of O
a O
neurotensin O
analog O
could O
produce O
antiparkinsonian O
effects. O
The O
present O
study O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
effects O
of O
pallidal O
neurotensin O
on O
haloperidol-induced O
parkinsonian B
symptoms. I
METHODS: O
Behavioral O
experiments O
and O
electrophysiological O
recordings O
were O
performed O
in O
the O
present O
study. O
RESULTS: O
Bilateral O
infusions O
of O
neurotensin O
into O
the O
globus O
pallidus O
reversed O
haloperidol-induced O
parkinsonian B
catalepsy I
in O
rats. O
Electrophysiological O
recordings O
showed O
that O
microinjection O
of O
neurotensin O
induced O
excitation O
of O
pallidal O
neurons O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
systemic O
haloperidol O
administration. O
The O
neurotensin O
type-1 O
receptor O
antagonist O
SR48692 O
blocked O
both O
the O
behavioral O
and O
the O
electrophysiological O
effects O
induced O
by O
neurotensin. O
CONCLUSION: O
Activation O
of O
pallidal O
neurotensin O
receptors O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
neurotensin-induced O
antiparkinsonian O
effects. O

We O
report O
a O
case O
of O
severe O
hypertension B
with O
an O
occluded O
renal O
artery O
to O
a O
solitary O
kidney, O
who O
developed O
sudden B
deterioration I
of I
renal I
function I
following O
treatment O
with O
captopril. O
His O
renal O
function O
remained O
impaired O
but O
stable O
during O
2 O
years' O
treatment O
with O
captopril O
but O
returned O
to O
pre-treatment O
levels O
soon O
after O
cessation O
of O
the O
drug. O
This O
indicates O
reversibility O
in O
captopril-induced O
renal B
failure I
even O
after O
its O
prolonged O
use O
and O
suggests O
that O
no O
organic O
damage O
occurs O
to O
glomerular O
arterioles O
following O
chronic O
ACE O
inhibition. O

The O
relationship O
of O
arthritis B
and O
sexual B
dysfunction I
was O
investigated O
among O
169 O
patients O
with O
rheumatoid B
arthritis, I
osteoarthritis B
and O
spondyloarthropathy, B
130 O
of O
whom O
were O
pair-matched O
to O
controls. O
Assessments O
of O

mood I
were O
also O
made O
using O
the O
CES-D O
and O
the O
Azrin O
Marital O
Happiness O
Scale O
(AMHS). O
Sexual B
dysfunctions I
were O
found O
to O
be O
common O
among O
patients O
and O
controls, O
the O
majority O
in O
both O
groups O
reporting O
one O
or O
more O
dysfunctions. O
Impotence B
was O
more O
common O
among O
male O
patients O
than O
controls O
and O
was O
found O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
co-morbidity O
and O
the O
taking O
of O
methotrexate. O
Depressed B
mood I
was O
more O
common O
among O
patients O
and O
was O
associated O
with O
certain O
sexual O
difficulties, O
but O
not O
with O
impotence. B
Marital O
unhappiness, O
as O
indicated O
by O
AMHS O
scores, O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
arthritis O
but O
was O
associated O
with O
sexual O
dysfunction, O
sexual O
dissatisfaction O
and O
being O
female. O

Treatment O
for O
scabies B
is O
usually O
initiated O
by O
general O
practitioners; O
most O
consider O
lindane O
(gamma O
benzene O
hexachloride) O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice. O
Lindane O
is O
also O
widely O
used O
as O
an O
agricultural O
and O
industrial O
pesticide, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
the O
toxic O
profile O
of O
this O
insecticide O
is O
well O
understood. O
Evidence O
is O
accumulating O
that O
lindane O
can O
be O
toxic B
to I
the I
central I
nervous I
system I
and O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
aplastic B
anaemia. I
Preparations O
containing O
lindane O
continue O
to O
be O
sold O
over O
the O
counter O
and O
may O
represent O
a O
hazard O
to O
poorly O
informed O
patients. O
This O
literature O
review O
suggests O
that O
general O
practitioners O
should O
prescribe O
scabicides O
with O
increased O
caution O
for O
certain O
at-risk O
groups, O
and O
give O
adequate O
warnings O
regarding O
potential O
toxicity. B

of O
220 O
cases O
of O
possible O
neurotoxic B
reactions O
to O
halogenated O

reported O
from O
outside O
Japan. O
In O
80 O
cases O
insufficient O
information O
was O
available O
for O
adequate O
comment O
and O
in O
29 O
a O
relationship O
to O
the O
administration O
of O
clioquinol O
could O
be O
excluded. O
Of O
the O
remainder, O
a O
relationship O
to O
clioquinol O
was O
considered O
probable O
in O
42 O
and O
possible O
in O
69 O
cases. O
In O
six O
of O
the O
probable O
cases O
the O
neurological B
disturbance I
consisted O
of O
an O
acute O
reversible O
encephalopathy B
usually O
related O
to O
the O
ingestion O
of O
a O
high O
dose O
of O
clioquinol O
over O
a O
short O
period. O
The O
most O
common O
manifestation, O
observed O
in O
15 O
further O
cases, O
was O
isolated O
optic B
atrophy. I
This O
was O
most O
frequently O
found O
in O
children, O
many O
of O
whom O
had O
received O
clioquinol O
as O
treatment O
for O
acrodermatitis B
enteropathica. I
In O
the O
remaining O
cases, O
a O
combination O
of O
myelopathy, B
visual B
disturbance, I
and O
peripheral B
neuropathy I
was O
the O
most O
common O
manifestation. O
Isolated O
myelopathy O
or O
peripheral O
neuropathy, O
or O
these O
manifestations O
occurring O
together, O
were O
infrequent. O
The O
onset O
of O
all O
manifestations O
(except O
toxic O
encephalopathy) O
was O
usually O
subacute, O
with O
subsequent O
partial O
recovery. O
Older O
subjects O
tended O
to O
display O
more O
side O
effects. O
The O
full O
syndrome O
of O
subacute O

was I
more O
frequent O
in O

they O
tended O
to O

A O
for O
a O
period O

8 O
days O
significantly O
attenuated O
isoproterenol-induced O

further O
confirmed O
by O

BACKGROUND: O
Although O
intravitreal O
aminoglycosides O
have O
substantially O
improved O
visual O
prognosis O
in O
endophthalmitis, B
macular O

METHODS: O
We O
present O
a O
case O
of O
presumed O
amikacin O
retinal B
toxicity I
following O
treatment O
with O
amikacin O
and O
vancomycin O
for O

RESULTS: O
Endophthalmitis B
resolved O
with O
improvement O
in O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Currently O
accepted O
intravitreal O
antibiotic O
regimens O
may O
cause O
retinal O
toxicity O
and O
macular O
ischaemia. B
Treatment O

fifty-one O
patients O
intolerant O
to O
zidovudine O
(AZT) O
received O
didanosine O
(ddI) O
to O
a O
maximum O
dose O
of O
12.5 O
mg/kg/day. O
Patient O
response O
was O
assessed O
using O
changes O
in O
CD4+ O
lymphocyte O

whilst O
on O
therapy; O
this O
was O
the O
first O
AIDS B

Only O
minor O
changes O
in O

were O
observed O
in O
AIDS O
patients, O
although O
a O
more O

at O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
study O
67% O
showed O
a O

this O
was O
most O
likely O
in O
those O
with O

were O
common. O
The O
most O
common O
side-effect O
was O
diarrhoea, B
which O
resulted O
in O
cessation O
of O

in O
19 O
individuals. O
Peripheral B

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
report O
a O
case O
of O
erythema B
multiforme I
and O
hypersensitivity B
myocarditis B
caused O
by O
ampicillin. O
CASE O
SUMMARY: O
A O
13-year-old O
boy O
was O
treated O
with O
ampicillin O
and O
gentamicin O
because O
of O
suspected O
septicemia. B
Medications O
were O
discontinued O
when O
erythema O
multiforme O
and O
congestive B
heart I
failure I
caused O
by O
myocarditis O
occurred. O
The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
methylprednisolone O
and O
gradually O
improved. O
Macrophage-migration O
inhibition O
(MIF) O
test O
with O
ampicillin O
was O
positive. O
DISCUSSION: O
After O
most O
infections B
causing O
erythema O
multiforme O
and O
myocarditis O
were O
ruled O
out, O
a O
drug-induced B
allergic I
reaction I
was O
suspected. O
Positive O
MIF O
test O
for O
ampicillin O
showed O
sensitization O
of O
the O
patient's O
lymphocytes O
to O
ampicillin. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Hypersensitivity B
myocarditis I
is O
a O
rare O
and O
dangerous O
manifestation O
of O

OBJECTIVE: O
The O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
compare O
the O
efficacy O
and O
side O
effects O
of O
two O
doses O
of O
haloperidol O
and O
placebo O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
psychosis B
and O
disruptive B
behaviors I
in O
patients O
with O
Alzheimer's B
disease. I
METHOD: O
In O
a O
6-week O
random-assignment, O
double-blind, O
placebo-controlled O
trial O
(phase O
A), O
haloperidol, O
2-3 O
mg/day O
(standard O
dose), O
and O
haloperidol, O
0.50-0.75 O
mg/day O
(low O
dose), O
were O
compared O
in O
71 O
outpatients O
with O
Alzheimer's O
disease. O
For O
the O
subsequent O
6-week O
double-blind O
crossover O
phase O
(phase O
B), O
patients O
taking O
standard- O
or O
low-dose O
haloperidol O
were O
switched O
to O
placebo, O
and O
patients O
taking O
placebo O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
standard- O
or O
low-dose O
haloperidol. O
RESULTS: O
For O
the O
60 O
patients O
who O
completed O
phase O
A, O
standard-dose O
haloperidol O
was O
efficacious O
and O
superior O
to O
both O
low-dose O
haloperidol O
and O
placebo O
for O
scores O
on O
the O
Brief O
Psychiatric O
Rating O
Scale O
psychosis O
factor O
and O
on O
psychomotor B
agitation. I
Response O
rates O
according O
to O
three O
sets O
of O
criteria O
were O
greater O
with O
the O
standard O
dose O
(55%-60%) O
than O
the O
low O
dose O
(25%-35%) O
and O
placebo O
(25%-30%). O
The O
advantage O
of O
standard O
dose O
over O
low O
dose O
was O
replicated O
in O
phase O
B. O
In O
phase O
A, O
extrapyramidal B
signs I
tended O
to O
be O
greater O
with O
the O
standard O
dose O
than O
in O
the O
other O
two O
conditions, O
primarily O
because O
of O
a O
subgroup O
(20%) O
who O
developed O
moderate O
to O
severe O
signs. O
Low-dose O
haloperidol O
did O
not O
differ O
from O
placebo O
on O
any O
measure O
of O
efficacy O
or O
side O
effects. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
results O
indicated O
a O
favorable O
therapeutic O
profile O
for O
haloperidol O
in O
doses O
of O
2-3 O
mg/day, O
although O
a O
subgroup O
developed O
moderate O
to O
severe O
extrapyramidal O
signs. O
A O
starting O
dose O
of O
1 O
mg/day O
with O
gradual, O
upward O
dose O
titration O
is O
recommended. O
The O
narrow O
therapeutic O
window O
observed O
with O
haloperidol O
may O
also O
apply O
to O
other O
neuroleptics O
used O
in O
Alzheimer's O
disease O
patients O
with O
psychosis O
and O
disruptive O
behaviors. O

Tonotopic O
organization O
is O
an O
essential O
feature O
of O
the O
primary O
auditory O
area O
(A1) O
of O
primate O
cortex. O
In O
A1 O
of O
macaque O
monkeys, O
low O
frequencies O
are O
represented O
rostrolaterally O
and O
high O
frequencies O
are O
represented O
caudomedially. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
if O
changes O
occur O
in O
this O
tonotopic O
organization O
following O
cochlear O
hearing B
loss. I
Under O
anesthesia, O
the O
superior O
temporal O
gyrus O
of O
adult O
macaque O
monkeys O
was O
exposed, O
and O
the O
tonotopic O
organization O
of O
A1 O
was O
mapped O
using O
conventional O
microelectrode O
recording O
techniques. O
Following O
recovery, O
the O
monkeys O
were O
selectively O
deafened O
for O
high O
frequencies O
using O
kanamycin O
and O
furosemide. O
The O
actual O
frequencies O
deafened O
were O
determined O
by O
the O
loss O
of O
tone-burst O
elicited O
auditory O
brainstem O
responses. O
Three O
months O
after O
deafening, O
A1 O
was O
remapped. O
Postmortem O
cytoarchitectural O
features O
identifying O
A1 O
were O
correlated O
with O
the O
electrophysiologic O
data. O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
deprived O
area O
of O
A1 O
undergoes O
extensive O
reorganization O
and O
becomes O
responsive O
to O
intact O
cochlear O
frequencies. O
The O
region O
of O
cortex O
that O
represents O
the O
low O
frequencies O
was O
not O
obviously O
affected O
by O
the O
cochlear O
hearing O
loss. O

Ketoconazole O
was O
introduced O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
in O
1981. O
By O
November O
1984 O
the O
Committee O
on O
Safety O
of O
Medicines O
had O
received O
82 O
reports O
of O
possible O
hepatotoxicity B
associated O
with O
the O
drug, O
including O
five O
deaths. B
An O
analysis O
of O
the O
75 O
cases O
that O
had O
been O
adequately O
followed O
up O
suggested O
that O
16, O
including O
three O
deaths, O
were O
probably O
related O
to O
treatment O
with O
the O
drug. O
Of O
the O
remainder, O
48 O
were O
possibly O
related O
to O
treatment, O
five O
were O
unlikely O
to O
be O
so, O
and O
six O
were O
unclassifiable. O
The O
mean O
age O
of O
patients O
in O
the O
16 O
probable O
cases O
was O
57.9, O
with O
hepatotoxicity O
being O
more O
common O
in O
women. O
The O
average O
duration O
of O
treatment O
before O
the O
onset O
of O
jaundice B
was O
61 O
days. O
None O
of O
these O
well O
validated O
cases O
occurred O
within O
the O
first O
10 O
days O
after O
treatment. O
The O
results O
of O
serum O
liver O
function O
tests O
suggested O
hepatocellular B
injury I
in O
10 O
(63%); O
the O
rest O
showed O
a O
mixed O
pattern. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
results O
of O
histological O
examination O
of O
the O
liver O
often O
showed O
evidence O
of O
cholestasis. B
The O
characteristics O
of O
the O
48 O
patients O
in O
the O
possible O
cases O
were O
similar. O
Allergic O
manifestations O
such O
as O
rash B
and O
eosinophilia B
were O
rare. O
Hepatitis B
was O
usually O
reversible O
when O
treatment O
was O
stopped, O
with O
the O
results O
of O
liver O
function O
tests O
returning O
to O
normal O
after O
an O
average O
of O
3.1 O
months. O
In O
two O
of O
the O
three O
deaths O
probably O
associated O
with O
ketoconazole O
treatment O
the O
drug O
had O
been O
continued O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
jaundice O
and O
other O
symptoms O
of O
hepatitis. B
Clinical O
and O
biochemical O
monitoring O
at O
regular O
intervals O
for O
evidence O
of O
hepatitis O
is O
advised O
during O
long O
term O
treatment O
with O
ketoconazole O
to O
prevent O
possible O
serious O
hepatic B
injury. I

Cephalosporin O
antibiotics O
cause O
a O
variety O
of O
hematologic B
disturbances I
in O
man, O
the O
pathogeneses O
and O
hematopathology O
of O
which O
remain O
poorly O
characterized. O
There O
is O
a O
need O
for O
a O
well-defined O
animal O
model O
in O
which O
these O
blood B
dyscrasias I
can O
be O
studied. O
In O
four O
subacute O
toxicity B
studies, O
the O
intravenous O
administration O
of O
cefonicid O
or O
cefazedone O
to O
beagle O
dogs O
caused O
a O
dose-dependent O
incidence O
of O
anemia, B
neutropenia, B
and O
thrombocytopenia B
after B
1-3 O
months O
of O
treatment. O
A O
nonregenerative O
anemia O
was O
the O
most O
compromising O
of O
the O
cytopenias B
and O
occurred O
in O
approximately O
50% O
of O
dogs O
receiving O
400-500 O
mg/kg O
cefonicid O
or O
540-840 O
mg/kg O
cefazedone. O
All O
three O
cytopenias O
were O
completely O
reversible O
following O
cessation O
of O
treatment; O
the O
time O
required O
for O
recovery O
of O
the O
erythron O
(approximately O
1 O
month) O
was O
considerably O
longer O
than O
that O
of O
the O
granulocytes O
and O
platelets O
(hours O
to O
a O
few O
days). O
Upon O
rechallenge O
with O
either O
cephalosporin, O
the O
hematologic B
syndrome I
was O
reproduced O
in O
most O
dogs O
tested; O
cefonicid O
(but O
not O
cefazedone)-treated O
dogs O
showed O
a O
substantially O
reduced O
induction O
period O
(15 O
+/- O
5 O
days) O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
the O
first O
exposure O
to O
the O
drug O
(61 O
+/- O
24 O
days). O
This O
observation, O
along O
with O
the O
rapid O
rate O
of O
decline O
in O
red O
cell O
mass O
parameters O
of O
affected O
dogs, O
suggests O
that O
a O
hemolytic B
component O
complicated O
the O
red O
cell O
production O
problem O
and O
that O
multiple O
toxicologic O
mechanisms O
contributed O
to O
the O
cytopenia. O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
administration O
of O
high O
doses O
of O
cefonicid O
or O
cefazedone O
to O
dogs O
can O
induce O
hematotoxicity B
similar O
to O
the O
cephalosporin-induced O
blood O
dyscrasias O
described O
in O
man O
and O
thus O
provides O
a O
useful O
model O
for O
studying O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
these O
disorders. O

BACKGROUND: O
Although O
the O
prevalence O
of O
nonsmall B
cell I
lung I
carcinoma I
(NSCLC) O
is B
high O
among O
elderly O
patients, O
few O
data O
are O
available O
regarding O
the O
efficacy O
and O
toxicity B
of O
chemotherapy O
in O
this O
group O
of O
patients. O
Recent O
reports O
indicate O
that O
single O
agent O
therapy O
with O
vinorelbine O
(VNB) O
or O
gemcitabine O
(GEM) O
may O
obtain O
a O
response O
rate O
of O
20-30% O
in O
elderly O
patients, O
with O
acceptable O
toxicity O
and O
improvement O
in O
symptoms O
and O
quality O
of O
life. O
In O
the O
current O
study O
the O
efficacy O
and O
toxicity O
of O
the O
combination O
of O
GEM O
and O
VNB O
in O
elderly O
patients O
with O
advanced O
NSCLC O
or O
those O
with O
some O
contraindication O
to O
receiving O
cisplatin O
were O
assessed. O
METHODS: O
Forty-nine O
patients O
with O
advanced O
NSCLC O
were O
included, O
38 O
of O
whom O
were O
age O
>/= O
70 O
years O
and O
11 O
were O
age O
< O
70 O
years O
but O
who O
had O
some O
contraindication O
to O
receiving O
cisplatin. O
All O
patients O
were O
evaluable O
for O
response O
and O
toxicity. O
Treatment O
was O
comprised O
of O
VNB, O
25 O
mg/m(2), O
plus O
GEM, O
1000 O
mg/m(2), O
both O
on O
Days O
1, O
8, O
and O
15 O
every O
28 O
days. O
Patients O
received O
a O
minimum O
of O
three O
courses O
unless O
progressive O
disease O
was O
detected. O
RESULTS: O
One O
hundred O
sixty-five O
courses O
were O
administered, O
with O
a O
median O
of O
3. O
6 O
courses O
per O
patient. O
The O
overall O
response O
rate O
was O
26% O
(95% O
confidence O
interval, O
15-41%). O
Two O
patients O
attained O
a O
complete O
response O
(4%) O
and O
11 O
patients O
(22%) O
achieved O
a O
partial O
response. O
Eastern O
Cooperative O
Oncology O
Group O
performance O
status O
improved O
in O
35% O
of O
those O
patients O
with O
an O
initial O
value O
> O
0, O
whereas O
relief O
of O
at O
least O
1 O
symptom O
without O
worsening O
of O
other O
symptoms O
was O
noted O
in O
27 O
patients O
(55%). O
The O
median O
time O
to O
progression O
was O
16 O
weeks O
and O
the O
1-year O
survival O
rate O
was O
33%. O
Toxicity B
was O
mild. O
Six O
patients O
(12%) O
had O
World O
Health O
Organization O
Grade O
3-4 O
neutropenia, B
2 O
patients O
(4%) O
had O
Grade O
3-4 O
thrombocytopenia, B
and O
2 O
patients O
(4%) O
had O
Grade O
3 O
neurotoxicity. B
Three O
patients O
with O
severe O
neutropenia O
(6%) O
died O
of O
sepsis. B
The O
median O
age O
of O
those O
patients O
developing O
Grade O
3-4 O
neutropenia O
was O
significantly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
remaining O
patients O
(75 O
years O
vs. O
72 O
years; O
P O
= O
0.047). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
combination O
of O
GEM O
and O
VNB O
is O
moderately O
active O
and O
well O
tolerated O
except O
in O
patients O
age O
>/= O
75 O
years. O
This O
age O
group O
had O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
myelosuppression. B
Therefore O
the O
prophylactic O
use O
of O
granulocyte-colony O
stimulating O
factor O
should O
be O
considered O
with O
this O
treatment. O
New O
chemotherapy O
combinations O
with O
higher O
activity O
and O
lower O
toxicity O
are O
needed O
for O
elderly O
patients O
with O
advanced O
NSCLC. O

Combined O
effects O
of O
prolonged O
prostaglandin O
E1 O
(PGE1)-induced O
hypotension B
and O
haemodilution B
on O
hepatic O
function O
were O
studied O
in O
30 O
patients O
undergoing O
hip O
surgery. O
The O
patients O
were O
randomly O
allocated O
to O
one O
of O
three O
groups; O
those O
in O
group O
A O
(n O

10) O
were O
subjected O
to O
controlled O
hypotension O
alone, O
those O
in O
group O
B O
(n O

alone O
and O
those O
in O
group O
C O
(n O

10) O
to O
both O
controlled O
hypotension O
and O
haemodilution. O
Haemodilution B
in O
groups O
B O
and O
C O
was O
produced O
by O
withdrawing O
approximately O
1000 O
mL O
of O
blood O
and O
replacing O
it O
with O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
dextran O
solution, O
and O
final O
haematocrit O
values O
were O
21 O
or O
22%. O
Controlled O
hypotension O
in O

was O
induced O
with O
PGE1 O
to O
maintain O
mean O
arterial O

is O
a O
rare, O
progressive O
and O
incurable O
disease, O
which O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
the O
intake O
of O

drugs. O
The O
importance O
of O
this O
association O
was O
evaluated O
in O
Belgium O
while O
this O
country O
still O
had O
no O
restriction O
on O
the O
prescription O
of O
appetite O
suppressants. O
Thirty-five O
patients O
with O
primary B
pulmonary I
hypertension I
and O
85 O
matched O
controls O
were O
recruited O
over O
32 O
months O
(1992-1994) O
in O
Belgium. O
Exposure O
to O
appetite-suppressants O
was O
assessed O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
hospital O
records O
and O
standardized O
interview. O
Twenty-three O
of O
the O
patients O
had O
previously O
taken O
appetite O
suppressants, O
mainly O
fenfluramines, O
as O
compared O
with O
only O
5 O
of O
the O
controls O
(66 O
versus O
6%, O
p<0.0001). O
Five O
patients O
died O
before O
the O
interview, O
all O
of O
them O
had O
taken O
appetite O
suppressants. O
In O
8 O
patients O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
primary O

5 O
of O
them O

The O
patients O
who O
had O
been O
exposed O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
describe O
associations O
between O
the O
use O
of O
benzodiazepines O
or O
related O
drugs O
(BZDs/RDs) O
and O
health, O
functional O

and O
cognitive O
function O
in O
the O

METHODS: O
A O
non-randomised O
clinical O
study O
of O
patients O
aged O
> O
or O
=65 O
years O
admitted O
to O
acute O
hospital O
wards O
during O
1 O
month. O
164 O
patients O
(mean O
age O
+/- O
standard O
deviation O
[SD] O
81.6 O
+/- O
6.8 O
years) O
were O
admitted. O
Of O
these, O
nearly O
half O
(n O
= O
78) O
had O
used O
BZDs/RDs O
before O
admission, O
and O
the O
remainder O
(n O
= O
86) O
were O
non-users. O
Cognitive O
ability O
was O
assessed O
by O
the O
Mini-Mental O
State O
Examination O
(MMSE). O
Patients O
scoring O
> O
or O
=20 O
MMSE O
sum O
points O
were O
interviewed O
(n O
= O
79) O
and O
questioned O
regarding O
symptoms O
and O
functional O
abilities O
during O
the O
week O
prior O
to O
admission. O
Data O
on O
use O
of O
BZDs/RDs O
before O
admission, O
current O
medications O
and O
discharge O
diagnoses O
were O
collected O
from O
medical O
records. O
Health, O
physical O
abilities O
and O
cognitive O
function O
were O
compared O
between O
BZD/RD O
users O
and O
non-users, O
and O
adjustments O
were O
made O
for O
confounding O
variables. O
The O
residual O
serum O
concentrations O
of O
oxazepam, O
temazepam O
and O
zopiclone O
were O
analysed. O
RESULTS: O
The O
mean O
+/- O
SD O
duration O
of O
BZD/RD O
use O
was O
7 O
+/- O
7 O
years O
(range O
1-31). O
Two O
or O
three O
BZDs/RDs O
were O
concomitantly O
taken O
by O
26% O
of O
users O
(n O
= O
20). O
Long-term O
use O
of O
these O
drugs O
was O
associated O
with O
female O
sex O
and O
use O
of O
a O
higher O
number O
of O
drugs O
with O
effects O
on O
the O
CNS, O
which O
tended O
to O
be O
related O
to O
diagnosed O
dementia. B
After O
adjustment O
for O
these O
variables O
as O
confounders, O
use O
of O
BZDs/RDs O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
cognitive O
function O
as O
measured O
by O
the O
MMSE. O
However, O
use O
of O
BZDs/RDs O
was O
associated O
with O
dizziness, B
inability B
to I
sleep I
after O
awaking O
at O
night O
and O
tiredness B
in O
the O
mornings O
during O
the O
week O
prior O
to O
admission O
and O
with O
stronger O
depressive B
symptoms I
measured O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
hospital O
stay. O
Use O
of O
BZDs/RDs O
tended O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
reduced O
ability O
to O
walk O
and O
shorter O
night-time O
sleep O
during O
the O
week O
prior O
to O
admission. O
A O
higher O
residual O
serum O
concentration O
of O
temazepam O
correlated O
with O
a O
lower O
MMSE O
sum O
score O
after O
adjustment O
for O
confounding O
variables. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Long-term O
use O
and O
concomitant O
use O
of O
more O
than O
one O
BZD/RD O
were O
common O
in O
elderly O
patients O
hospitalised O
because O
of O
acute O
illnesses. O
Long-term O
use O
was O
associated O
with O
daytime O
and O
night-time O
symptoms O
indicative O
of O
poorer O
health O
and O
potentially O
caused O
by O
the O
adverse O

Thirty-two O
healthy O

volunteers O
were O
randomly O
allocated O
to O
four O
different O
groups. O
They O
were O
given O
a O
ten O
day O
pretreatment O
with O
either O
L-alpha-GFC O

The O
findings O

indicate O
that O
the O

able O
to O
antagonize O

The O
effect O
of O
amiloride O
on O
lithium-induced O

and O
on O
the O
lithium O
concentration O
in O
the O
plasma, O
brain, O
kidney, O
thyroid O
and O
red O
blood O
cells O
was O
investigated O
in O
rats, O
chronically O
treated O
with O
LiCl. O
Amiloride O
reduced O
the O
drinking O
and O
urine O
volume O
of O
rats O
in O
an O
acute O
(6 O
or O
12 O
h) O
and O
a O
subacute O
(3 O
days) O
experiment. O
6 O
h O
after O
the O
administration O
of O
amiloride, O
a O
reduction O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
lithium O
content O
of O
the O
renal O
medulla O
but O
not O
in O
the O
other O
organs O
studied. O
At O
12 O
h, O
all O
the O
tissues O
showed O
a O
slight O
increase O
in O
lithium O
levels. O
After O
3 O
days O
of O
combined O
treatment, O
a O
marked O
elevation O
in O
plasma O
and O
tissue O
lithium O
levels O
accompanied O
a O
reduction O
in O
water O
intake. O
In O
all O
the O
experiments, O
the O
attenuation O
of O
the O
lithium-induced O
diabetes-insipidus-like B
syndrome I
by O
amiloride O
was O
accompanied O
by O
a O
reduction O
of O
the O
ratio O
between O
the O
lithium O
concentration O
in O
the O
renal O
medulla O
and O
its O
levels O
in O
the O
blood O
and O
an O
elevation O
in O
the O
plasma O
potassium O
level. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
acute O
amiloride O
administration O
to O
lithium-treated O
patients O
suffering O
from O
polydipsia O
and O
polyuria O
might O
relieve O
these O
patients O
but O
prolonged O
amiloride O
supplementation O
would O
result O
in O
elevated O
lithium O
levels O
and O
might O
be O
hazardous. O

The O
present O
study O
was O
aimed O
at O
investigating O
the O
effects O
of O
Daucus O
carota O
seeds O
on O
cognitive O
functions, O
total O
serum O
cholesterol O
levels O
and O
brain O
cholinesterase O
activity O
in O
mice. O
The O
ethanolic O
extract O
of O
Daucus O
carota O
seeds O
(DCE) O
was O
administered O
orally O
in O
three O
doses O
(100, O
200, O
400 O
mg/kg) O
for O
seven O
successive O
days O
to O
different O
groups O
of O
young O
and O
aged O
mice. O
Elevated O
plus O
maze O
and O
passive O
avoidance O
apparatus O
served O
as O
the O
exteroceptive O
behavioral O
models O
for O
testing O
memory. O
Diazepam-, O
scopolamine- O
and O
ageing-induced O
amnesia B
served O
as O
the O
interoceptive O
behavioral O
models. O
DCE O
(200, O
400 O
mg/kg, O
p.o.) O
showed O
significant O
improvement O
in O
memory O
scores O
of O
young O
and O
aged O
mice. O
The O
extent O
of O
memory O
improvement O
evoked O
by O
DCE O
was O
23% O
at O
the O
dose O
of O
200 O
mg/kg O
and O
35% O
at O
the O
dose O
of O
400 O
mg/kg O
in O
young O
mice O
using O
elevated O
plus O
maze. O
Similarly, O
significant O
improvements O
in O
memory O
scores O
were O
observed O
using O
passive O
avoidance O
apparatus O
and O
aged O
mice. O
Furthermore, O
DCE O
reversed O
the O
amnesia O
induced O
by O
scopolamine O
(0.4 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.) O
and O
diazepam O
(1 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.). O
Daucus O
carota O
extract O
(200, O
400 O
mg/kg, O
p.o.) O
reduced O
significantly O
the O
brain O
acetylcholinesterase O
activity O
and O
cholesterol O
levels O
in O
young O
and O
aged O
mice. O
The O
extent O
of O
inhibition O
of O
brain O
cholinesterase O
activity O
evoked O
by O
DCE O
at O
the O
dose O
of O
400 O
mg/kg O
was O
22% O
in O
young O
and O
19% O
in O
aged O
mice. O
There O
was O
a O
remarkable O
reduction O
in O
total O
cholesterol O
level O
as O
well, O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
23% O
in O
young O
and O
21% O
in O
aged O
animals O
with O
this O
dose O
of O
DCE. O
Therefore, O
DCE O
may O
prove O
to O
be O
a O
useful O
remedy O
for O
the O
management O
of O
cognitive B
dysfunctions I
on O
account O
of O
its O
multifarious O
beneficial O
effects O
such O
as, O
memory O
improving O
property, O
cholesterol O
lowering O
property O
and O
anticholinesterase O
activity. O

BACKGROUND: O
Glioblastoma B
is O
a O
malignant B
tumor I
that O
occurs O
in O
the O
cerebrum O
during O
adulthood. O
With O
current O
treatment O
regimens O
including O
combined O
surgery, O
radiation O
and O
chemotherapy, O
the O
average O
life O
expectancy O
of O
the O
patients O
is O
limited O
to O
approximately O
1 O
year. O
Therefore, O
patients O
with O
glioblastoma B
sometimes O
have O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carcinostatics O
added O
to O
the O
treatment O
regimen. O
Generally, O
carboplatin O
is O
said O
to O
have O
milder O
side O
effects O
than O
cisplatin, O
whose O
ocular B
and I
orbital B
toxicity B
are O
well O
known. O
However, O
we O
experienced O
a O
case O
of O
severe O
ocular O
and O
orbital O
toxicity O
after O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carboplatin, O
which O
is O
infrequently O
reported. O
CASE: O
A O
58-year-old O
man O
received O
an O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carboplatin O
for O
recurrent O
glioblastomas B
in O
his O
left O
temporal O
lobe. O
He O
complained O
of O
pain B
and I
visual B
disturbance I
in I
the I
ipsilateral I
eye I
30 O
h O
after O
the O
injection. O
Various O
ocular O
symptoms O
and O
findings O
caused O
by O
carboplatin O
toxicity O
were O
seen. O
RESULTS: O
He O
was O
treated O
with O
intravenous O
administration O
of O
corticosteroids O
and O
glycerin O
for O
6 O
days O
after O
the O
injection. O
Although O
the O
intraocular O
pressure O
elevation O
caused O
by O
secondary O
acute O
angle-closure O
glaucoma B
decreased O
and O
ocular B
pain I
diminished, O
inexorable O
papilledema B
and O
exudative O
retinal B
detachment I
continued O
for O
3 O
weeks. O
Finally, O
6 O
weeks O
later, O
diffuse O
chorioretinal B
atrophy I
with O
optic B
atrophy I
occurred O
and O
the O
vision O
in O
his O
left O
eye O
was O
lost. O
CONCLUSION: O
When O
performing O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carboplatin, O
we O
must O
be O
aware O
of O
its O
potentially O
blinding O
ocular B
toxicity. I
It O
is O
recommended O
that O
further O
studies O
and O
investigations O
are O
undertaken O
in O
the O
effort O
to O
minimize O
such O
severe O
side O
effects. O

We O
prospectively O
evaluated O
the O
adverse O

of O
apraclonidine O
in O
20 O
normal O
volunteers O
by O
instilling O
a O
single O
drop O
of O
1% O
apraclonidine O
in O
their O
right O
eyes. O
Examinations, O
including O
blood O

at O
1, O
3, O
5 O
and O
7 O

The O
ocular B
hypotensive I
effects O
were O
statistically O
significant O
for O
apraclonidine-treated O
eyes O
throughout O
the O
study O
and O
also O
statistically O
significant O
for O
contralateral O
eyes O
from O
three O
hours O
after O
topical O
administration O
of O
1% O
apraclonidine. O
Decreases B
in I
systolic I

were O
statistically, O
but O
not O
clinically, O
significant. O
No O
significant O
changes O
in O
diastolic O
blood O
pressure, O
pulse O
rate O
and O
basal O
tear O
secretion O
were O
noted. O
Conjunctival B
blanching I
and O
mydriasis B
were O
commonly O
found. O
Upper O
lid O

was O
frequently O
noted. O
While O
the O
elevations O
of O
the O
upper O
lid O
margin O
in O
most O
subjects O
were O
not O
more O
than O
2 O
mm O
and O
did O
not O
cause O
noticeable O
change O
in O
appearance, O
one O
subject O
suffered O
from O
mechanical O
entropion B
and O
marked O
corneal B

3 O
hours O
after O
instillation O
of O
the O
medication. O
This O
may O

RESULTS: O
Forty O
of O

Eight O
of O
the O

thus, O
a O

the O

Cardona O
et O
al. O
[Nat. O
Neurosci. O
9 O
(2006), O
917] O
recently O
identified O
the O
microglial-specific O
fractalkine O
receptor O
(CX3CR1) O
as O
an O
important O
mediator O
of O
MPTP-induced O
neurodegeneration B
of O
DA O
neurons. O
Because O
the O
CNS B
damage I
caused O
by O
METH O
and O
MPTP O
is O
highly O
selective O
for O
the O
DA O
neuronal O
system O
in O
mouse O
models O
of O
neurotoxicity, B
we O
hypothesized O
that O
the O
CX3CR1 O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
METH-induced O
neurotoxicity O
and O
microglial O
activation. O
Mice O
in O
which O
the O
CX3CR1 O
gene O
has O
been O
deleted O
and O
replaced O
with O
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
enhanced O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
(eGFP) O
were O
treated O
with O
METH O
and O
examined O
for O
striatal O
neurotoxicity. O
METH O
depleted O
DA, O
caused O
microglial O
activation, O
and O
increased O
body O
temperature O
in O
CX3CR1 O
knockout O
mice O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
and O
over O
the O
same O
time O
course O
seen O
in O
wild-type O
controls. O
The O
effects O
of O
METH O
in O
CX3CR1 O
knockout O
mice O
were O
not O
gender-dependent O
and O
did O
not O
extend O
beyond O
the O
striatum. O
Striatal O
microglia O
expressing O
eGFP O
constitutively O
show O
morphological O
changes O
after O
METH O
that O
are O
characteristic O
of O
activation. O
This O
response O
was O
restricted O
to O
the O
striatum O
and O
contrasted O
sharply O
with O
unresponsive O
eGFP-microglia O
in O
surrounding O
brain O
areas O
that O
are O
not O
damaged O
by O
METH. O
We O
conclude O
from O
these O
studies O
that O
CX3CR1 O
signaling O
does O
not O
modulate O
METH O
neurotoxicity O
or O
microglial O
activation. O
Furthermore, O
it O
appears O
that O
striatal-resident O
microglia O
respond O
to O
METH O
with O
an O
activation O
cascade O
and O
then O
return O
to O
a O
surveying O
state O
without O
undergoing O
apoptosis O
or O
migration. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

to O
evaluate O
the O
relationship O
between O
phenytoin O

who O
had O
experienced O

Five O

21-59 O

age, O
were O
examined O
with O
a O
1.5-T O
whole-body O

using O
a O

Conventional O
spin O

were O
acquired O
in O
the O

In O

we O
performed O
a O
high-resolution O
3D O

T1-weighted O
sequences O
at O
a O
1-mm O

thickness. O
The O
images O
were O
subsequently O
processed O
to O
obtain O
volumetric O
data O
for O
the O

Cerebellar O
volume O
for O
the O
patient O
group O
ranged O
between O
67.66 O

In O

sets O
from O
10 O
healthy O
male O

10 O
healthy O
female O
age-matched O
volunteers O
were O
used O
to O
compare O
cerebellar O
volumes. O
Using O
linear O
regression O
we O
found O
that O
no O
correlation O
exists O
between O
seizure B
duration, O
elevation O
of O
phenytoin O
serum O
levels O
and O
cerebellar O
volume. O
However, O
multiple O
regression O
for O
the O
daily O
dosage, O
duration O
of O
phenytoin O
treatment O
and O
cerebellar O
volume O
revealed O
a O
correlation O
of O
these O
parameters. O
We O
conclude O
that O
phenytoin O
overdosage B
does O
not O
necessarily O
result O
in O
cerebellar O
atrophy O
and O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
phenytoin O

was O
the O
only O
cause O

in O
the O

OBJECTIVES: O
The O
United O

Parkinson's B

an O
increased O
mortality O
in O

Parkinson's B
disease I
(PD) O
randomized O
to O
receive O
10 O
mg O
selegiline O
per O
day O
and O
L-dopa O
compared O
with O
those O
taking O
L-dopa O
alone. O
Recently, O
we O
found O
that O
therapy O
with O
selegiline O
and O
L-dopa O
was O
associated O
with O
selective O
systolic B
orthostatic B
hypotension I
which O
was O
abolished O
by O
withdrawal O
of O
selegiline. O
This O
unwanted O
effect O
on O
postural O
blood O
pressure O
was O
not O
the O
result O
of O
underlying O
autonomic O
failure. O
The O
aims O
of O
this O
study O
were O
to O
confirm O
our O
previous O
findings O
in O
a O
separate O
cohort O
of O
patients O
and O
to O
determine O
the O
time O

of O
the O
cardiovascular O
consequences O
of O
stopping O
selegiline O
in O
the O
expectation O
that O
this O
might O
shed O
light O
on O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
the O
drug O
causes O
orthostatic O
hypotension. O
METHODS: O
The O
cardiovascular O
responses O
to O
standing O
and O
head-up O
tilt O
were O
studied O
repeatedly O
in O
PD O
patients O
receiving O
selegiline O
and O
as O
the O
drug O
was O
withdrawn. O
RESULTS: O
Head-up O
tilt O
caused O
systolic O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
which O
was O
marked O
in O
six O
of O
20 O
PD O
patients O
on O
selegiline, O
one O
of O
whom O
lost O
consciousness O
with O
unrecordable O
blood O
pressures. O
A O
lesser O
degree O
of O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
occurred O
with O
standing. O
Orthostatic B
hypotension I
was O
ameliorated O
4 O
days O
after O
withdrawal O
of O
selegiline O
and O
totally O
abolished O
7 O
days O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
drug. O
Stopping O
selegiline O
also O
significantly O
reduced B
the I
supine I
systolic I
and I
diastolic I
blood I

consistent O
with O
a O
previously O
undescribed O
supine O

action. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
study O
confirms O
our O
previous O
finding O
that O
selegiline O
in O
combination O
with O
L-dopa O
is O
associated O
with O
selective O
orthostatic O
hypotension. O
The O
possibilities O
that O
these O
cardiovascular O
findings O
might O
be O
the O
result O
of O
non-selective O
inhibition O
of O
monoamine O

or O
of O
amphetamine O

are O
discussed. O

The O
co-administration O
of O

in O

An O

FANFT O
at O
a O
level O
of O
0.2% O
and/or O
aspirin O
at O
a O
level O
of O
0.5% O
to O

the O

on O
the O

induced O
by O
FANFT O
in O
the O
forestomach O

FANFT-induced O
cell O

in O
the O
bladder O
was O
significantly O
suppressed O
by O
aspirin O
co-administration O
after O
4 O
weeks O
but O
not O
after O
12 O
weeks. O
In O
the O
forestomach, O
and O
also O
in O
the O
liver, O
aspirin O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
FANFT-induced O
increase O
in O

index. O
The O
present O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
carcinogenicity O
experiment O
suggesting O
that O
different O
mechanisms O
are O
involved O
in O
FANFT O
carcinogenesis B
in O
the O
bladder O
and O
forestomach, O
and O
that O
aspirin's O
effect O
on O
FANFT O
in O
the O
forestomach O
is O
not O
due O
to O
an O
irritant O
effect O
associated O
with O

proliferation. O
Also, O
there O
appears O
to O

Two O
days O
before O

diltiazem O
(60 O

was O
prescribed O

Analyses O

metoprolol O
(greater O
than O
3000 O

(526 O

and O
sparteine O
(as O
a O

It O
was O

Moreover, O
the O

In O
this O
report O
we O
describe O
the O
case O
of O
a O
37-year-old O
white O
woman O
with O
Ebstein's B
anomaly, I
who O
developed O
a O
rare O
syndrome O
called O
platypnea-orthodeoxia, B
characterized O
by O
massive O
right-to-left O
interatrial O
shunting O
with O
transient O
profound O
hypoxia B
and O
cyanosis. B
This O
shunt O
of O
blood O
via O
a O
patent B
foramen I
ovale I
occurred O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
normal O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressure, O
and O
was O
probably O
precipitated O
by O
a O
propafenone O
overdose. B
This O
drug O
caused O
biventricular B
dysfunction, I
due O
to O
its O
negative O
inotropic O
effect, O
and O
hypotension, B
due O
to O
its O
peripheral O
vasodilatory O
effect. O
These O
effects O
gave O
rise O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
and O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
left O
one O
with O
a O
consequent O
stretching O
of O
the O
foramen O
ovale O
and O
the O
creation O
of O
massive O
right-to-left O
shunting. O
In O
our O
case O
this O
interatrial O
shunt O
was O
very O
accurately O
detected O
at O
bubble O
contrast O

BACKGROUND: O
An O
association O
has O
been O
found O
between O
transplant B
glomerulopathy I
(TG) O
and B
reduplication O
of O
peritubular O
capillary O
basement O
membranes O
(PTCR). O
Although O
such O
an O
association O
is O
of O
practical O
and O
theoretical O
importance, O
only O
one O
prospective O
study O
has O
tried O
to O
confirm O
it. O
METHODS: O
We O
examined O
278 O
consecutive O
renal O
specimens O
(from O
135 O
transplants O
and O
143 O
native O
kidneys) O
for O
ultrastructural O
evidence O
of O
PTCR. O
In O
addition O
to O
renal O
allografts O
with O
TG, O
we O
also O
examined O
grafts O
with O
acute O
rejection, O
recurrent O
glomerulonephritis, B
chronic B
allograft I
nephropathy I
and O
stable O
grafts O
("protocol O
biopsies"). O
Native O
kidney O
specimens O
included O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
glomerulopathies B
as O
well O
as O
cases O
of O
thrombotic B
microangiopathy, I
malignant B
hypertension, I
acute O
interstitial B
nephritis, I
and O
acute B
tubular I
necrosis. I
RESULTS: O
We O
found O
PTCR O
in O
14 O
of O
15 O
cases O
of O
TG, O
in O
7 O
transplant O
biopsy O
specimens O
without O
TG, O
and O
in O
13 O
of O
143 O
native O
kidney O
biopsy O
specimens. O
These O
13 O
included O
cases O
of O
malignant O
hypertension, O
thrombotic O
microangiopathy, O
lupus B
nephritis, I
Henoch-Schonlein B
nephritis, I
crescentic O
glomerulonephritis, O
and O
cocaine-related O
acute B
renal B
failure. I
Mild O
PTCR O
in O
allografts O
without O
TG O
did O
not O
predict O
renal O
failure O
or O
significant O
proteinuria B
after O
follow-up O
periods O
of O
between O
3 O
months O
and O
1 O
year. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
We O
conclude O
that O
in O
transplants, O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
association O
between O
well-developed O
PTCR O
and O
TG, O
while O
the O
significance O
of O
mild O
PTCR O
and O
its O
predictive O
value O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
TG O
is O
unclear. O
PTCR O
also O
occurs O
in O
certain O
native O
kidney B
diseases, I
though O
the O
association O
is O
not O
as O
strong O
as O
that O
for O
TG. O
We O
suggest O
that O
repeated O
endothelial B
injury, I
including O
immunologic B
injury, I
may O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
this O
lesion O
both O
in O
allografts O
and O
native O
kidneys. O

To O
develop O
a O
novel O
and O
effective O
drug O
that O
could O
enhance O
cognitive O
function O
and O
neuroprotection, O
we O
newly O
synthesized O
maltolyl O
p-coumarate O
by O
the O
esterification O
of O
maltol O
and O
p-coumaric O
acid. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
investigated O
whether O
maltolyl O
p-coumarate O
could O
improve O
cognitive B
decline I
in O
scopolamine-injected O
rats O
and O
in O
amyloid O
beta O
peptide(1-42)-infused O
rats. O
Maltolyl O
p-coumarate O
was O
found O
to O
attenuate O
cognitive B
deficits I
in O
both O
rat O
models O
using O
passive O
avoidance O
test O
and O
to O
reduce O
apoptotic O
cell O
death O
observed O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
of O
the O
amyloid O
beta O
peptide(1-42)-infused O
rats. O
We O
also O
examined O
the O
neuroprotective O
effects O
of O
maltolyl O
p-coumarate O
in O
vitro O
using O
SH-SY5Y O
cells. O
Cells O
were O
pretreated O
with O
maltolyl O
p-coumarate, O
before O
exposed O
to O
amyloid O
beta O
peptide(1-42), O
glutamate O
or O
H2O2. O
We O
found O
that O
maltolyl O
p-coumarate O
significantly O
decreased O
apoptotic O
cell O
death O
and O
reduced O
reactive O
oxygen O
species, O
cytochrome O
c O
release, O
and O
caspase O
3 O
activation. O
Taking O
these O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo O
results O
together, O
our O
study O
suggests O
that O
maltolyl O
p-coumarate O
is O
a O
potentially O
effective O
candidate O
against O
Alzheimer's B
disease I
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
wide O
spread O
neuronal B
death I
and O
progressive O
decline B

cognitive I
function. I

Anencephaly B
has O
been O
suggested O
to O
develop O
from O
exencephaly; B
however, O
there O
is O
little O
direct O
experimental O
evidence O
to O
support O
this, O
and O
the O
mechanism O
of O
transformation O
remains O
unclear. O
We O
examined O
this O
theory O
using O
the O
exo O
utero O
development O
system O
that O
allows O
direct O
and O
sequential O
observations O
of O
mid- O
to O
late-gestation O
mouse O
embryos. O
We O
observed O
the O
exencephaly O
induced O
by O
5-azacytidine O
at O
embryonic O
day O
13.5 O
(E13.5), O
let O
the O
embryos O
develop O
exo O
utero O
until O
E18.5, O
and O
re-observed O
the O
same O
embryos O
at O
E18.5. O
We O
confirmed O
several O
cases O
of O
transformation O
from O
exencephaly O
to O
anencephaly. B
However, O
in O
many O
cases, O
the O
exencephalic B
brain O
tissue O
was O
preserved O
with O
more O
or O
less O
reduction O
during O
this O
period. O
To O
analyze O
the O
transformation O
patterns, O
we O
classified O
the O
exencephaly O
by O
size O
and O
shape O
of O
the O
exencephalic O
tissue O
into O
several O
types O
at O
E13.5 O
and O
E18.5. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
the O
transformation O
of O
exencephalic O
tissue O
was O
not O
simply O
size-dependent, O
and O
all O
cases O
of O
anencephaly O
at O
E18.5 O
resulted O
from O
embryos O
with O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
exencephalic O
tissue O
at O
E13.5. O
Microscopic O
observation O
showed O
the O
configuration O
of O
exencephaly O
at O
E13.5, O
frequent O
hemorrhaging B
and O
detachment O
of O
the O
neural O
plate O
from O
surface O
ectoderm O
in O
the O
exencephalic O
head O
at O
E15.5, O
and O
multiple O
modes O
of O
reduction O
in O
the O
exencephalic O
tissue O
at O
E18.5. O
From O
observations O
of O
the O
vasculature, O
altered O
distribution O
patterns O
of O
vessels O
were O
identified O
in O
the O
exencephalic O
head. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
overgrowth O
of O
the O
exencephalic O
neural O
tissue O
causes O
the O
altered O
distribution O
patterns O
of O
vessels, O
subsequent O
peripheral O
circulatory B
failure I
and/or O
hemorrhaging O
in O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
exencephalic O
head, O
leading O
to O
the O
multiple O
modes O
of O
tissue O
reduction O
during O
transformation O
from O
exencephaly O
to O
anencephaly. O

RESULTS: O
The O

patients O
(14.3%). O
This O
CAB-induced O
anemia O
was O
normochromic O

normocytic. O
At O
six O

had O
a O
Hb O

13.2 O
+/- O
0.17 O
(X O

The O
development O
of O
severe O

at O
6 O

post-CAB O
was O
predictable O
by O
the O

The O

BACKGROUND: O
Papaverine O
hydrochloride O
is O
a O
direct-acting O
vasodilator O
used O
to O
manage O
vasospasm B
during O
various O
neurosurgical O
operations. O
Transient O
cranial B
nerve I
dysfunction I
has O
been O
described O
in O
a O
few O
cases O
with O
topical O
papaverine. O
This O
study O
supports O
previous O
reports O
and O
provides O
neurophysiological O
evidence O
of O
an O
adverse O
effect O
on O
the O
auditory O
nerve. O
METHODS: O
We O
conducted O
a O
retrospective O
review O
of O
70 O
consecutive O
microvascular O
decompression O
operations O
and O
studied O
those O
patients O
who O
received O
topical O
papaverine O
for O
vasospasm. O
Topical O
papaverine O
was O
used O
as O
a O
direct O
therapeutic O
action O
to O
manage O
vasospasm O
in O
a O
total O
of O
11 O
patients. O
The O
timing O
of O
papaverine O
application O
and O
ongoing O
operative O
events O
was O
reviewed O
relative O
to O
changes O
in O
neurophysiological O
recordings. O
Brainstem O
auditory O
evoked O
potentials O
(BAEPs) O
were O
routinely O
used O
to O
monitor O
cochlear O
nerve O
function O
during O
these O
operations. O
FINDINGS: O
A O
temporal O
relationship O
was O
found O
between O
topical O
papaverine O
and O
BAEP O
changes O
leading O
to O
complete O
waveform O
loss. O
The O
average O
temporal O
delay O
between O
papaverine O
and O
the O
onset O
of O
an O
adverse O
BAEP O
change O
was O
5 O
min. O
In O
10 O
of O
11 O
patients, O
BAEP O
waves O
II/III-V O
completely O
disappeared O
within O
2 O
to O
25 O
min O
after O
papaverine. O
Eight O
of O
these O
10 O
patients O
had O
complete O
loss O
of O
BAEP O
waveforms O
within O
10 O
min. O
One O
patient O
showed O
no O
recovery O
of O
later O
waves O
and O
a O
delayed O
profound O
sensorineural B
hearing I
loss. I
The O
average O
recovery O
time O
of O
BAEP O
waveforms O
to O
pre-papaverine O
baseline O
values O
was O
39 O
min. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Topical O
papaverine O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
vasospasm O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
onset O
of O
a O
transient O
disturbance O
in O
neurophysiological O
function O
of O
the O
ascending O
auditory O
brainstem O
pathway. O
The O
complete O
disappearance O
of O
BAEP O
waveforms O
with O
a O
consistent O
temporal O
delay O
suggests O
a O
possible O
adverse B
effect I
on I
the I
proximal I
eighth I
nerve. I
Recommendations O

Two O

studied O
under O

conditions, O
one O
during O
the O
night, O
when O
sleeping O
(n O

and O
the O
other O
at O

when O

Each O

received O
a O

2 O
hours O
before O

calculated O
by O
a O

For O
both O

We O

by O
a O

We O

the O

female O
who O
was O
treated O
with O
methylphenidate O
due O

We O
consider O

the O
most O
likely O
cause O
of O
recurrent O
ischaemic O
strokes O
in O
the O

We O
conclude O
that O
methylphenidate O

vasculitis O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
patients O
with O
neurological O
symptoms O
and O
a O
history O

This O
potential O

one O
more O
reason O

The O
effects O

on O
the O

were O
studied O
in O
female O
albino O
rats O
of O
20,40,60 O
and O
80 O
weeks O
of O
age. O
The O
rats O
were O
trained O
to O
swim O
for O
a O
specific O
duration O
and O
for O
a O
particular O
period. O
The O
occurrence O
of O
infarcts B
were O
confirmed O
by O
histological O
methods. O
Elevations O
in O
the O
serum O
GOT O
and O
GPT O
were O
maximum O
in O
the O
sedentary-isoproterenols O
and O
minimum O
in O
the O
exercise-controls. O
These O
changes O
in O
the O
serum O
transaminases O
were O
associated O
with O
corresponding O
depletions O
in O
the O
cardiac O
GOT O
and O
GPT. O
However, O
age O
was O
seen O
to O
interfere O
with O
the O
responses O
exhibited O
by O
the O
young O
and O
old O
rats. O

Through O
30 O
years O
of O
widespread O
use, O
acetaminophen O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
a O
remarkably O
safe O
medication O
in O
therapeutic O
dosages. O
The O
potential O
for O
acetaminophen O
to O
produce O
cardiovascular B
toxicities I
is O
very O
low. O
However, O
acetaminophen O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
to O
produce O
symptoms O
of O
anaphylaxis, B
including O
hypotension, B
in O
sensitive O
individuals. O
This O
article O
describes O
two O
critically B
ill I
patients O
in O
whom O
transient O
episodes O

reproducibly O
developed O
after O

of O
acetaminophen. O
Other O
symptoms O

reactions I
were O
not O
clinically O
detectable. O
The O
hypotensive B
episodes O
were O
severe O
enough O
to O
require O

The O

The O
authors O
present O
three O
patients O
with O
de O

epilepsy B
after O
administration O
of O
carbamazepine O
and O
vigabatrin. O
Despite O
the O
underlying O
diseases, O
the O
prognosis O
for O
drug-induced O
de O
novo O
absence B
seizure B
is O
good O
because O
it O
subsides O
rapidly O
after O
discontinuing O
the O
use O
of O
the O
offending O
drugs. O
The O
gamma-aminobutyric O
acid-transmitted O
thalamocortical O
circuitry O
accounts O
for O
a O
major O
part O
of O
the O
underlying O
neurophysiology O
of O
the O
absence O
epilepsy. O
Because O
drug-induced O
de O
novo O
absence O
seizure O
is O
rare, O
pro-absence O
drugs O
can O
only O
be O
considered O
a O
promoting O
factor. O
The O
underlying O
epileptogenecity O
of O
the O
patients O
or O
the O
synergistic O
effects O
of O
the O
accompanying O
drugs O
is O
required O
to O
trigger O
the O
de O
novo O
absence O
seizure. O
The O
possibility O
of O
drug-induced O
aggravation O
should O
be O
considered O
whenever O
an O
unexpected O
increase O
in O
seizure O
frequency O
and/or O
new O
seizure O
types O
appear O
following O
a O
change O
in O
drug O
treatment. O
By O
understanding O
the O
underlying O
mechanism O
of O
absence O
epilepsy, O
we O
can O
avoid O
the O
inappropriate O
use O
of O
anticonvulsants O
in O
children O
with O
epilepsy O
and O
prevent O
drug-induced O

BACKGROUND: O
Sirolimus O
is O
the O
latest O
immunosuppressive O
agent O
used O
to O
prevent O
rejection, O
and O
may O
have O
less O
nephrotoxicity B
than O
calcineurin O
inhibitor O
(CNI)-based O
regimens. O
To O
date O
there O
has O
been O
little O
documentation O
of O
clinically O
significant O
proteinuria B
linked O
with O
the O
use O
of O
sirolimus. O
We O
have O
encountered O
several O
patients O
who O
developed O
substantial O
proteinuria O
associated O
with O
sirolimus O
use. O
In O
each O
patient, O
the O
close O
temporal O
association O
between O
the O
commencement O
of O
sirolimus O
therapy O
and O
proteinuria O
implicated O
sirolimus O
as O
the O
most O
likely O
etiology O
of O
the O
proteinuria. O
METHODS: O
We O
analyzed O
the O
clinical O
and O
laboratory O
information O
available O
for O
all O
119 O
patients O
transplanted O
at O
the O
Washington O
Hospital O
Center O
between O
1999-2003 O
for O
whom O
sirolimus O
was O
a O
component O
of O
their O
immunosuppressant O
regimen. O
In O
these O
patients, O
the O
magnitude O
of O
proteinuria O
was O
assessed O
on O
morning O
urine O
samples O
by O
turbidometric O
measurement O
or O
random O
urine O
protein:creatinine O
ratios, O
an O
estimate O
of O
grams O
of O
proteinuria/day. O
Laboratory O
results O
were O
compared O
between O
prior, O
during O
and O
following O
sirolimus O
use. O
RESULTS: O
Twenty-eight O
patients O
(24%) O
developed O
increased O
proteinuria O
from O
baseline O
during O
their O
post-transplantation O
course. O
In O
21 O
patients O
an O
alternative O
cause O
of O
proteinuria O
was O
either O
obvious O
or O
insufficient O
data O
was O
available O
to O
be O
conclusive. O
In O
7 O
of O
the O
28 O
patients O
there O
was O
a O
striking O
temporal O
association O
between O
the O
initiation O
of O
sirolimus O
and O
the O
development O
of O
nephrotic-range B
proteinuria. O
Proteinuria B
correlated O
most O
strongly O
with O
sirolimus O
therapy O
when O
compared O
to O
other O
demographic O
and O
clinical O
variables. O
In O
most O
patients, O
discontinuation O
of O
sirolimus O
resulted O
in O
a O
decrease, O
but O
not O
resolution, O
of O
proteinuria. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Sirolimus O
induces O
or O
aggravates O
pre-existing O
proteinuria O
in O
an O
unpredictable O
subset O
of O
renal O
allograft O
recipients. O
Proteinuria O
may O
improve, O
but O
does O
not O
resolve, O
when O
sirolimus O
is O
withdrawn. O

Cardiac B
arrhythmias I
have O
frequently O

reported O
in O
association O
with O
respiratory B
failure. I
The O
possible O
additive O
role O
of O
pharmacologic O
agents O
in O
precipitating O
cardiac B
disturbances I
in O
patients O
with O
respiratory O
failure O
has O
only O
recently O
been O
emphasized. O
The O
effects O
of O
aminophylline O
on O
the O
ventricular B
fibrillation I
threshold O
during O
normal O
acid-base O
conditions O
and O
during O
respiratory O
failure O
were O
studied O
in O
anesthetized O
open O
chest O
dogs. O
The O
ventricular O
fibrillation O
threshold O
was O
measured O
by O
passing O
a O
gated O
train O
of O
12 O
constant O
current O
pulses O
through O
the O
ventricular O
myocardium O
during O
the O
vulnerable O
period O
of O
the O
cardiac O
cycle. O
During O
the O
infusion O
of O
aminophylline, O
the O
ventricular O
fibrillation O
threshold O
was O
reduced O
by O
30 O
to O
40 O
percent O
of O
the O
control O
when O
pH O
and O
partial O
pressures O
of O
oxygen O
(PO2) O
and O
carbon O
dioxide O
(CO2) O
were O
kept O
within O
normal O
limits. O
When O
respiratory O
failure O
was O
produced O
by O
hypoventilation B
(pH O
7.05 O
to O
7.25; O
PC02 O
70 O
to O
100 O
mm O
Hg: O
P02 O
20 O
to O
40 O
mm O
Hg), O
infusion O
of O
aminophylline O
resulted O
in O
an O
even O
greater O
decrease O
in O
ventricular O
fibrillation O
threshold O
to O
60 O
percent O
of O
the O
control O
level. O
These O
experiments O
suggest O
that O
although O
many O
factors O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
increased O
incidence O
of O
ventricular B
arrhythmias I
in O
respiratory O
failure, O
pharmacologic O
agents, O
particularly O
aminophylline, O
may O
play O
a O
significant O
role. O

The O
epidemiological O
studies O
that O
assessed O
the O
risk O
of O
venous B
thromboembolism I
(VTE) O
associated B
with O
newer O
oral O
contraceptives O
(OC) O
did O
not O
distinguish O
between O
patterns O
of O
OC O
use, O
namely O
first-time O
users, O
repeaters O
and O
switchers. O
Data O
from O
a O
Transnational O
case-control O
study O
were O
used O
to O
assess O
the O
risk O
of O
VTE O
for O
the O
latter O
patterns O
of O
use, O
while O
accounting O
for O
duration O
of O
use. O
Over O
the O
period O
1993-1996, O
551 O
cases O
of O
VTE O
were O
identified O
in O
Germany O
and O
the O
UK O
along O
with O
2066 O
controls. O
Totals O
of O
128 O
cases O
and O
650 O
controls O
were O
analysed O
for O
repeat O
use O
and O
135 O
cases O
and O
622 O
controls O
for O
switching O
patterns. O
The O
adjusted O
rate O
ratio O
of O
VTE O
for O
repeat O
users O
of O
third O
generation O
OC O
was O
0.6 O
(95% O
CI:0.3-1.2) O
relative O
to O
repeat O
users O
of O
second O
generation O
pills, O
whereas O
it O
was O
1.3 O
(95% O
CI:0.7-2.4) O
for O
switchers O
from O
second O
to O
third O
generation O
pills O
relative O
to O
switchers O
from O
third O
to O
second O
generation O
pills. O
We O
conclude O
that O
second O
and O
third O
generation O
agents O
are O
associated O
with O
equivalent O
risks O
of O
VTE O
when O
the O
same O
agent O
is O
used O
repeatedly O
after O
interruption O
periods O
or O
when O
users O
are O
switched O
between O
the O
two O
generations O
of O
pills. O
These O
analyses O
suggest O
that O
the O
higher O
risk O
observed O
for O
the O
newer O
OC O
in O
other O
studies O
may O
be O
the O
result O
of O
inadequate O
comparisons O
of O
pill O
users O
with O
different O
patterns O
of O
pill O
use. O

Seven O
cases O
of O
procainamide-induced O
polymorphous O
ventricular B
tachycardia I
are O
presented. O
In O
four O
patients, O
polymorphous O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
appeared O
after O
intravenous O
administration O
of O
200 O
to O
400 O
mg O
of O
procainamide O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
sustained O
ventricular O
tachycardia. O
In O
the O
remaining O
three O
patients, O
procainamide O
was O
administered O
orally O
for O
treatment O
of O
chronic O
premature B
ventricular I
contractions I
or O
atrial B
flutter. I
These O
patients O
had O
Q-T B
prolongation I
and O
recurrent O
syncope B
due O
to O
polymorphous O
ventricular O
tachycardia. O
In O
four O
patients, O
the O
arrhythmia B
was O
rapidly O
diagnosed O
and O
treated O
with O
disappearance O
of O
further O
episodes O
of O
the O
arrhythmia. O
In O
two O
patients, O
the O
arrhythmia O
degenerated O
into O
irreversible O
ventricular B
fibrillation I
and O
both O
patients O
died. O
In O
the O
seventh O
patient, O
a O
permanent O
ventricular O
pacemaker O
was O
inserted O
and, O
despite O
continuation O
of O
procainamide O
therapy, O
polymorphous O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
did O
not O
reoccur. O
These O
seven O
cases O
demonstrate O
that O
procainamide O
can O
produce O
an O
acquired O
prolonged B
Q-T I
syndrome I
with O
polymorphous O
ventricular O
tachycardia. O

OBJECTIVE: O
The O
outcome O

METHODS: O
A O
review O
of O

This O
group O
was O

with O
a O

RESULTS: O
The O

group O
were O
significantly O
younger O
than O
the O
patients O
in O
the O

In O
patients O
in O
the O
study O
group, O
all O
aneurysms O
were O
located O
in O
the O

circulation. O
The O
majority O
of O
these O

were O
smaller O
than O
those O
of O
the O

group O
(8 O
+/- O
6.08 O
mm O
versus O
11 O
+/- O
5.4 O
mm; O
P O
= O

The O
differences O
in O

between O
the O

CONCLUSION: O
Cocaine O

been O
reported O

However, O
the O
incidence O

severity O
of O
these O

vary O
from O

and O
their O

OBJECTIVES: O
To O
estimate O
the O
frequency O
and O
severity O
of O
valvular B
heart I
abnormality I
and O
its O
possible O
reversibility O
after O
drug O
withdrawal O
in O
a O
case-control O
study. O
METHODS: O
All O
PD O
patients O
in O
the O
Amiens O
area O
treated O
with O
pergolide O
were O
invited O
to O
attend O
a O
cardiologic O
assessment O
including O
transthoracic O
echocardiography. O
Thirty O
PD O
patients O
participated O
in O
the O
study. O
A O
second O
echocardiography O
was O
performed O
(median O
interval: O
13 O
months) O
after O
pergolide O
withdrawal O
(n=10 O
patients). O
Controls O
were O
age- O
and O
sex-matched O
non-PD O
patients O
referred O
to O
the O
cardiology O
department. O
RESULTS: O
Compared O
to O
controls, O
aortic B
regurgitation I
(OR: O
3.1; O
95% O
IC: O
1.1-8.8) O
and O
mitral B
regurgitation I
(OR: O
10.7; O
95% O
IC: O
2.1-53) O
were O
more O
frequent O
in O
PD O
patients O
(tricuspid: O
NS). O
The O
number O
of O
affected O
valves O
(n=2.4+/-0.7) O
and O
the O
sum O
of O
regurgitation O
grades O
(n=2.8+/-1.09) O
were O
higher O
(p=0.008 O
and O
p=0.006, O
respectively) O
in O
the O
pergolide O
group. O
Severity O
of O
regurgitation O
was O
not O
correlated O
with O
pergolide O
cumulative O
dose. O
A O
restrictive O
pattern O
of O
valvular B
regurgitation, I
suggestive O
of O
the O
role O
of O
pergolide, O
was O
observed O
in O
12/30 O
(40%) O
patients O
including O
two O
with O
heart B
failure. I
Pergolide O
was O
discontinued O
in O
10 O
patients O
with O
valvular B
heart I
disease, I
resulting O
in O
a O
lower O
regurgitation O
grade O
(p=0.01) O
at O
the O
second O
transthoracic O
echocardiography O
and O
the O
two O
patients O
with O
heart O
failure O
returned O
to O
nearly O
normal O
clinical O
examination. O
This O
study O
supports O
the O
high O
frequency O
of O
restrictive O
valve B
regurgitation I
in O
PD O
patients O
treated O
with O
pergolide O
and O
reveals O
that O
a O
significant O
improvement O
is O
usual O
when O
the O
treatment O
is O
converted O
to O
non-ergot O
dopamine O
agonists. O

A O
synergistic O
effect O
of O
etoposide O
and O
cyclosporin O
A O
was O
observed O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
acute B
T-lymphocytic I
leukemia I
in O
relapse. O
The O
concomitant O
administration O
of O
etoposide O
and O
cyclosporin O
A O
resulted O
in O
eradication O
of O
hitherto O
refractory O
leukemic B
infiltration I
of O
bone O
marrow. O
Severe O
side O
effects O
in O
terms O
of O
mental O
confusion B
and O
progressive O
hyperbilirubinemia, B
however, O
point O
to O
an O
enhancement O
not O
only O
of O
antineoplastic O
effects O
but O
also O
of O
toxicity B
in O
normal O
tissues. O
This O
report O
demonstrates O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
the O
pharmacodynamic O
properties O
of O
cyclosporin O
A O
may O
not O
be O
confined O
strictly O
to O
suppression O
of O
normal O
T-cell O
functions. O

We O
report O
the O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
amoxicillin-clavulanic O
acid-induced O
hepatitis B
with O
histologic O
multiple O
granulomas. B
This O
type O
of O
lesion O
broadens O
the O
spectrum O
of O
liver B
injury I
due O
to O
this O
drug O
combination, O
mainly O
represented O
by O
a O
benign O
cholestatic B
syndrome. I
The O
association O
of O
granulomas O
and O
eosinophilia B
favor O
an O
immunoallergic O
mechanism. O
As O
penicillin O
derivatives O
and O
amoxicillin O
alone O
are O
known O
to O
induce O
such O
types O
of O
lesions, O
the O
amoxicillin O
component, O
with O
or O
without O
a O
potentiating O
effect O
of O
clavulanic O
acid, O
might O
have O
a O
major O
role. O

Different O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
suggested O
for O
cocaine O
toxicity B
including O
an O
increase O
in O
oxidative O
stress O
but O
the O
association O
between O
oxidative O
status O
in O
the O
brain O
and O
cocaine O
induced-behaviour O
is O
poorly O
understood. O
Nuclear O
factor O
kappa O
B O
(NFkappaB) O
is O
a O
sensor O
of O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
participates O
in O
memory O
formation O
that O
could O
be O
involved O
in O
drug O
toxicity O
and O
addiction O
mechanisms. O
Therefore O
NFkappaB O
activity, O
oxidative O
stress, O
neuronal O
nitric O
oxide O
synthase O
(nNOS) O
activity, O
spatial O
learning O
and O
memory O
as O
well O
as O
the O
effect O
of O
topiramate, O
a O
previously O
proposed O
therapy O
for O
cocaine B
addiction, I
were O
evaluated O
in O
an O
experimental O
model O
of O
cocaine O
administration O
in O
rats. O
NFkappaB O
activity O
was O
decreased O
in O
the O
frontal O
cortex O
of O
cocaine O
treated O
rats, O
as O
well O
as O
GSH O
concentration O
and O
glutathione O
peroxidase O
activity O
in O
the O
hippocampus, O
whereas O
nNOS O
activity O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
was O
increased. O
Memory O
retrieval O
of O
experiences O
acquired O
prior O
to O
cocaine O
administration O
was O
impaired O
and O
negatively O
correlated O
with O
NFkappaB O
activity O
in O
the O
frontal O
cortex. O
In O
contrast, O
learning O
of O
new O
tasks O
was O
enhanced O
and O
correlated O
with O
the O
increase O
of O
nNOS O
activity O
and O
the O
decrease O
of O
glutathione O
peroxidase. O
These O
results O
provide O
evidence O
for O
a O
possible O
mechanistic O
role O
of O
oxidative O
and O
nitrosative O
stress O
and O
NFkappaB O
in O
the O
alterations O
induced O
by O
cocaine. O
Topiramate O
prevented O
all O
the O
alterations O
observed, O
showing O
novel O
neuroprotective O
properties. O

Nicotine O
activates O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system O
and O
in O
this O
way O
could O
contribute O
to O
cardiovascular B
disease. I
Animal O
studies O
and O
mechanistic O
studies O
indicate O
that O
nicotine O
could O
play O
a O
role O
in O
accelerating O
atherosclerosis, B
but O
evidence O
among O
humans O
is O
too O
inadequate O
to O
be O
definitive O
about O
such O
an O
effect. O
Almost O
certainly, O
nicotine O
via O
its O
hemodynamic O
effects O
contributes O
to O
acute O
cardiovascular O
events, O
although O
current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
nicotine O
are O
much O
less O
important O
than O
are O
the O
prothrombotic O
effects O
of O
cigarette O
smoking O
or O
the O
effects O
of O
carbon O
monoxide. O
Nicotine O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
enhance O
thrombosis B
among O
humans. O
Clinical O
studies O
of O
pipe O
smokers O
and O
people O
using O
transdermal O
nicotine O
support O
the O
idea O
that O
toxins O
other O
than O
nicotine O
are O
the O
most O
important O
causes O
of O
acute O
cardiovascular O
events. O
Finally, O
the O
dose O
response O
for O
cardiovascular O
events O
of O
nicotine O
appears O
to O
be O
flat, O
suggesting O
that O
if O
nicotine O
is O
involved, O
adverse O
effects O
might O
be O
seen O
with O
relatively O
low-level O
cigarette O
exposures. O

Cocaine's O
ability O
to O
interact O
with O
sigma O
receptors O
suggests O
that O
these O
proteins O
mediate O
some O
of O
its O
behavioral O
effects. O
Therefore, O
three O
novel O
sigma O
receptor O
ligands O
with O
antagonist O
activity O
were O
evaluated O
in O
Swiss O
Webster O
mice: O
BD1018 O
(3S-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane), O
BD1063 O
(1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine), O
and O
LR132 O
(1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine). O
Competition O
binding O
assays O
demonstrated O
that O
all O
three O
compounds O
have O
high O
affinities O
for O
sigma1 O
receptors. O
The O
three O
compounds O
vary O
in O
their O
affinities O
for O
sigma2 O
receptors O
and O
exhibit O
negligible O
affinities O
for O
dopamine, O
opioid, O
GABA(A) O
and O
NMDA O
receptors. O
In O
behavioral O
studies, O
pre-treatment O
of O
mice O
with O
BD1018, O
BD1063, O
or O
LR132 O
significantly O
attenuated O
cocaine-induced O
convulsions B
and O
lethality. O
Moreover, O
post-treatment O
with O
LR132 O
prevented O
cocaine-induced O
lethality O
in O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
animals. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
protection O
provided O
by O
the O
putative O
antagonists, O
the O
well-characterized O
sigma O
receptor O
agonist O
di-o-tolylguanidine O
(DTG) O
and O
the O
novel O
sigma O
receptor O
agonist O
BD1031 O
(3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) O
each O
worsened O
the O
behavioral O
toxicity B
of O
cocaine. O
At O
doses O
where O
alone, O
they O
produced O
no O
significant O
effects O
on O
locomotion, O
BD1018, O
BD1063 O
and O
LR132 O
significantly O
attenuated O
the O
locomotor O
stimulatory O
effects O
of O
cocaine. O
To O
further O
validate O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
anti-cocaine O
effects O
of O
the O
novel O
ligands O
involved O
antagonism O
of O
sigma O
receptors, O
an O
antisense O
oligodeoxynucleotide O
against O
sigma1 O
receptors O
was O
also O
shown O
to O
significantly O
attenuate O
the O
convulsive B
and O
locomotor O
stimulatory O
effects O
of O
cocaine. O
Together, O
the O
data O
suggests O
that O
functional O
antagonism O
of O
sigma O

is O
capable O
of O
attenuating O
a O

We O

the O
hypotensive B

clonidine O
(mixed O

in O

and O
implicates O

The O
present O

investigated O
whether O
this O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
examine O
the O
safety O

of O
clonidine O
used O
alone O
or O
with O
methylphenidate O
in O
children O

disorder I
(ADHD). O
METHOD: B
In O
a O
16-week O
multicenter, O
double-blind O
trial, O
122 O
children O
with O
ADHD O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
clonidine O
(n O

31), O
methylphenidate O
(n O
= O
29), O
clonidine O
and O
methylphenidate O
(n O
= O
32), O
or O
placebo O
(n O
= O
30). O
Doses O
were O
flexibly O
titrated O
up O
to O
0.6 O
mg/day O
for O
clonidine O
and O
60 O
mg/day O
for O
methylphenidate O
(both O
with O
divided O
dosing). O
Groups O
were O
compared O
regarding O
adverse O
events O
and O
changes O
from O
baseline O
to O
week O
16 O
in O
electrocardiograms O
and O
vital O

RESULTS: O
There O
were O
more O
incidents O
of O
bradycardia B
in O
subjects O
treated O
with O
clonidine O
compared O
with O
those O
not O
treated O
with O
clonidine O
(17.5% O
versus O
3.4%; O
p O
=.02), O
but O
no O
other O
significant O
group O
differences O
regarding O
electrocardiogram O

other O
cardiovascular O
outcomes. O
There O
were O
no O
suggestions O
of O
interactions O
between O
clonidine O
and O
methylphenidate O
regarding O
cardiovascular O
outcomes. O
Moderate O
or O
severe O
adverse O
events O
were O
more O
common O
in O
subjects O
on O
clonidine O
(79.4% O
versus O
49.2%; O
p O

but O
not O
associated O
with O
higher O
rates O

Drowsiness B
was O
common O
on O
clonidine, O
but O
generally O
resolved O
by O
6 O

8 O
weeks. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Clonidine, O
used O
alone O
or O
with O
methylphenidate, O
appears O
safe O
and O
well O
tolerated O
in O
childhood O
ADHD. O
Physicians O
prescribing O
clonidine O
should O
monitor O
for O
bradycardia O
and O
advise O
patients O
about O
the O
high O
likelihood O
of O
initial O

Anthracyclines O
are O
effective O
antineoplastic O
drugs, O
but O
they O
frequently O
cause O

cardiotoxicity. B
The O
cardiotoxicity O
of O
conventional O
anthracycline O
therapy O
highlights O
a O
need O
to O
search O
for O
methods O
that O
are O
highly O
sensitive O
and O
capable O
of O
predicting O
cardiac B
dysfunction. I
We O
measured O
the O
plasma O
level O
of O
brain O
natriuretic O
peptide O
(BNP) O
to O
determine O
whether O
BNP O
might O
serve O
as O
a O
simple O
diagnostic O
indicator O
of O
anthracycline-induced O
cardiotoxicity O
in O
patients O
with O
acute B
leukemia I
treated O
with O
a O
daunorubicin O
(DNR)-containing O
regimen. O
Thirteen O
patients O
with O
acute O
leukemia O
were O
treated O
with O
a O
DNR-containing O
regimen. O
Cardiac O
functions O
were O
evaluated O
with O
radionuclide O
angiography O
before O
chemotherapies. O
The O
plasma O
levels O
of O
atrial O
natriuretic O
peptide O
(ANP) O
and O
BNP O
were O
measured O
at O
the O
time O
of O
radionuclide O
angiography. O
Three O
patients O
developed O
congestive B
heart B
failure I
after O
the O
completion O
of O
chemotherapy. O
Five O
patients O
were O
diagnosed O
as O
having O
subclinical O
heart O
failure O
after O
the O
completion O
of O
chemotherapy. O
The O
plasma O
levels O
of O
BNP O
in O
all O
the O
patients O
with O
clinical O
and O
subclinical O
heart O
failure O
increased O
above O
the O
normal O
limit O
(40 O
pg/ml) O
before O
the O
detection O
of O
clinical O
or O
subclinical O
heart O
failure O
by O
radionuclide O
angiography. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
BNP O
did O
not O
increase O
in O
the O
patients O
without O
heart O
failure O
given O
DNR, O
even O
at O
more O
than O
700 O
mg/m(2). O
The O
plasma O
level O
of O
ANP O
did O
not O
always O
increase O
in O
all O
the O
patients O
with O
clinical O
and O
subclinical O
heart O
failure. O
These O
preliminary O
results O
suggest O
that O
BNP O
may O
be O
useful O
as O
an O
early O
and O
sensitive O
indicator O
of O
anthracycline-induced O
cardiotoxicity. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Reassuringly, O
penicillins, O
erythromycins, O
and O
cephalosporins, O
although O
used O
commonly O
by O
pregnant O
women, O
were O
not O
associated O
with O
many O

Sulfonamides O
and O
nitrofurantoins O
were O
associated O
with O

In O

yr) O
receiving O
cimetidine O
therapeutically O
two O
serum O
samples O
and O
all O
urine O
formed O
in O
the O
interim O
were O
collected O
for O
analysis O
of O
cimetidine O
by O
high-pressure O
liquid O

and O
for O
creatinine. O
Cimetidine O
clearance O
decreased O
with O
age. O
The O
extrapolated O
6-hr O
serum O
concentration O
of O
cimetidine O
per O
unit O
dose, O
after O
intravenous O
cimetidine, O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
patients. O
The O
ratio O
of O
cimetidine O
clearance O
to O
creatinine O
clearance O
(Rc) O
averaged O
4.8 O
+/- O
2.0, O
indicating O
net O
tubular O
secretion O
for O
cimetidine. O
Rc O
seemed O
to O
be O
independent O
of O
age O
and O
decreased O
with O
increasing O
serum O
concentration O
of O
cimetidine, O
suggesting O
that O
secretion O
of O
cimetidine O
is O
a O
saturable O
process. O
There O
was O
only O
one O
case O
of O

possibly O
due O
to O
cimetidine O
(with O
a O
drug O
level O

patients O
without O

or I
kidney B
disease I
who O
had O
cimetidine O
levels O
above O
1.25 O

Thus, O
high O
cimetidine O
levels O
alone O
do O
not O
always O
induce O
dementia. O

A O
61-year-old O
man O
was O
treated O
with O
combination O
chemotherapy O
incorporating O
cisplatinum, O
etoposide, O
high-dose O
5-fluorouracil O
(2,250 O
mg/m2/24 O
hours) O
and O
folinic O
acid O
for O
an O
inoperable O
gastric B
adenocarcinoma. I
He O
developed O
acute O
neurologic O
symptoms O
of O
mental O
confusion, B
disorientation B
and O
irritability, B
and O
then O
lapsed O
into O
a O
deep O
coma, B
lasting O
for O
approximately O
40 O
hours O
during O
the O
first O
dose O
(day O
2) O
of O
5-fluorouracil O
and O
folinic O
acid O
infusion. O
This O
complication O
reappeared O
on O
day O
25 O
during O
the O
second O
dose O
of O
5-fluorouracil O
and O
folinic O
acid, O
which O
were O
then O
the O
only O
drugs O
given. O
Because O
folinic O
acid O
was O
unlikely O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
this O
condition, O
neurotoxicity B
due O
to O
high-dose O
5-fluorouracil O
was O
highly O
suspected. O
The O
pathogenesis O
of O
5-fluorouracil O
neurotoxicity O
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
Krebs O
cycle O
blockade O
by O
fluoroacetate O
and O
fluorocitrate, O
thiamine O
deficiency, O
or O
dihydrouracil O
dehydrogenase O
deficiency. O
High-dose O
5-fluorouracil/folinic O
acid O
infusion O
therapy O
has O
recently O
become O
a O
popular O
regimen O
for O
various O
cancers. B
It O
is O
necessary O
that O
both O
oncologists O
and O
neurologists O
be O
fully O
aware O
of O
this O
unusual O
complication. O

In O
acute B
pain I
models, O
N-methyl-D-aspartate O
(NMDA) O
antagonists O
enhance O
the O
antinociceptive O
effects O
of O
morphine O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
in O
males O
than O
females. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
investigation O
was O
to O
extend O
these O
findings O
to O
a O
persistent O
pain O
model O
which O
could O
be O
distinguished O
from O
acute O
pain O
models O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
nociceptive O
fibers O
activated, O
neurochemical O
substrates, O
and O
duration O
of O
the O
nociceptive O
stimulus. O
To O
this O
end, O
persistent O
hyperalgesia B
was O
induced O
by O
administration O
of O
capsaicin O
in O
the O
tail O
of O
gonadally O
intact O
F344 O
rats, O
following O
which O
the O
tail O
was O
immersed O
in O
a O
mildly O
noxious O
thermal O
stimulus, O
and O
tail-withdrawal O
latencies O
measured. O
For O
comparison, O
tests O
were O
conducted O
in O
two O
acute O
pain O
models, O
the O
hotplate O
and O
warm O
water O
tail-withdrawal O
procedures. O
In O
males, O
the O
non-competitive O
NMDA O
antagonist O
dextromethorphan O
enhanced O
the O
antihyperalgesic O
effect O
of O
low O
to O
moderate O
doses O
of O
morphine O
in O
a O
dose-and O
time-dependent O
manner. O
Across O
the O
doses O
and O
pretreatment O
times O
examined, O
enhancement O
was O
not O
observed O
in O
females. O
Enhancement O
of O
morphine O
antinociception O
by O
dextromethorphan O
was O
seen O
in O
both O
males O
and O
females O
in O
the O
acute O
pain O
models, O
with O
the O
magnitude O
of O
this O
effect O
being O
greater O
in O
males. O
These O
findings O
demonstrate O
a O
sexually-dimorphic O
interaction O
between O
NMDA O
antagonists O
and O
morphine O
in O
a O
persistent O
pain O
model O
that O
can O
be O

Taken O

that O
the O
central O

of O
U-II O
at O
doses O

1-10,000 O

induces O
anxiogenic- O

These O

BACKGROUND: O
In O
man, O
differences O
in O
angiotensin-converting O
enzyme O
(ACE) O
levels, O
related O
to O
ACE O
(I/D) O
genotype, O
are O
associated O
with O
renal O
prognosis. O
This O
raises O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
individual O
differences O
in O
renal O
ACE O
activity O
are O
involved O
in O
renal O
susceptibility O
to O
inflicted O
damage. O
Therefore, O
we O
studied O
the O
predictive O
effect O
of O
renal O
ACE O
activity O
for O
the O
severity O
of O
renal B
damage I
induced O
by O
a O
single O
injection O
of O
adriamycin O
in O
rats. O
METHODS: O
Renal O
ACE O
activity O
(Hip-His-Leu O
cleavage O
by O
cortical O
homogenates) O
was O
determined O
by O
renal O
biopsy O
in O
27 O
adult O
male O
Wistar O
rats. O
After O
1 O
week O
of O
recovery, O
proteinuria B
was O
induced O
by O
adriamycin O
[1.5 O
mg/kg O
intravenously O
(i.v.) O
n O
= O
18; O
controls, O
saline O
i.v. O
n O
= O
9]. O
Proteinuria B
was O
measured O
every O
2 O
weeks. O
After O
12 O
weeks, O
rats O
were O
sacrificed O
and O
their O
kidneys O
harvested. O
RESULTS: O
As O
anticipated, O
adriamycin O
elicited O
nephrotic B
range O
proteinuria, O
renal B
interstitial I
damage I
and O
mild O
focal B
glomerulosclerosis. I
Baseline O
renal O
ACE O
positively O
correlated O
with O
the O
relative O
rise O
in O
proteinuria O
after O
adriamycin O
(r O
= O
0.62, O
P<0.01), O
renal O
interstitial O
alpha-smooth O
muscle O
actin O
(r O
= O
0.49, O

P<0.05), O

P<0.05), O
glomerular O
alpha-smooth O

(r O
= O
0.74, O
P<0.01) O
and O
glomerular O
desmin O
(r O
= O
0.48, O
P<0.05). O
Baseline O
renal O
ACE O
did O
not O
correlate O
with O
focal O
glomerulosclerosis O
(r O
= O
0.22, O
NS). O
In O
controls, O
no O
predictive O
values O
for O
renal O
parameters O
were O
observed. O
CONCLUSION: O
Individual O
differences O
in O
renal O
ACE O
activity O
predict O
the O
severity O
of O
adriamycin-induced O
renal O
damage O
in O
this O
outbred O
rat O
strain. O
This O
supports O
the O
assumption O
that O
differences O
in O
renal O
ACE O
activity O
predispose O
to O
a O
less O
favourable O
course O
of O
renal O
damage. O

Twenty O
common O
migraine B
patients O
received O
a O
one O
sided O
frontotemporal O
application O
of O
nitroglycerin O
(10 O
patients) O
or O
placebo O
ointment O
(10 O
patients) O
in O
a O
double O
blind O
study. O
Early O
onset O
migraine O
attacks O
were O
induced O
by O
nitroglycerin O
in O
seven O
out O
of O
10 O
patients O
versus O
no O
patient O
in O
the O
placebo O
group. O
Subsequently O
20 O
migraine O
patients, O
who O
developed O
an O
early O
onset O
attack O
with O
frontotemporal O
nitroglycerin, O
received O
the O
drug O
in O
a O
second O
induction O
test O
at O
other O
body O
areas. O
No O
early O

migraine O
was O
observed. O
Thus O
the O
migraine-inducing O
effect O
of O
nitroglycerin O
seems O
to O
depend O
on O
direct O
stimulation O
of O
the O
habitual O
site O

suggesting O
that O
the O
frontotemporal O
region O
is O
of O
crucial O
importance O
in O
the O
development O
of O
a O
migraine O
crisis. O
This O
is O
not O
consistent O
with O
a O
CNS O
origin O
of O
migraine O
attack. O

METHOD: O
The O

RESULTS: O
Switches O

In O

The O
number O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
frequency O
of O
mood O
switching O
associated O
with O
acute O
antidepressant O
therapy O
may O
be O
reduced O
by O
lithium O
