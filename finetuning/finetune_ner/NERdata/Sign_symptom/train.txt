However O
, O
after O

 O
It O
was O
thought O
that O
his O

 O
The O
next O
day O
, O
a O
two O

 O
Given O

for O
coronary O

( O

and O
ischemic O
cardiomyopathy O
( O
CMP O
) O
, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
our O
patient O
’s O
CMP O
was O
related O
to O
the O
recent O
use O
of O
gemcitabine O
. O

 O
Our O
patient O
was O
then O
started O
on O
carvedilol O
and O
an O
angiotensin O

and O
he O
was O
discharged O
from O
the O

two O
days O
later O
in O
a O
euvolemic O
state O
. O

 O
At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
cardiology O
department O
recommended O
stopping O
further O
chemotherapy O
with O
gemcitabine O
. O

 O
The O
oncology O
department O
advised O
further O
testing O
to O
rule O
out O
ischemia O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
CMP O
as O
, O
in O
their O
opinion O
, O
chemotherapy O
with O
gemcitabine O
was O
the O
only O
option O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
recurrence O
in O
this O
patient O
. O

 O
Two O
weeks O
later O
, O
our O
patient O
underwent O
myocardial O

a O
fixed O
small- O

without O
any O
evidence O
of O
active O
ischemia O
. O

 O
The O
ejection O
fraction O
( O
EF O
) O
on O
MPI O
was O
calculated O
to O
be O
around O
17 O
to O
20 O
percent O
with O
severe O
global O
hypokinesia O
. O

 O
Our O
patient O
was O
continued O
on O

with O
one O
more O
admission O
to O
the O

 O
He O
responded O
well O
to O
IV O
furosemide O
and O
adjustment O
of O

. O

 O
A O
2D O
Echo O
was O
repeated O
a O
few O
months O
later O
and O
it O
showed O
improvement O
in O
systolic O
function O
with O
an O
LVEF O
of O
40 O
percent O
. O

 O
Due O
to O
his O
poor O
functional O
status O
and O
underlying O
CMP O
, O
further O
gemcitabine O
chemotherapy O
was O
stopped O
. O

 O
Later O
, O
our O
patient O
developed O
a O
recurrence O
of O
his O
pancreatic O

he O
refused O

 O
Following O
discussion O
at O

During O

he O

required O

 O
He O
continued O

 O
As O

 O
During O
this O

, O
the O

 O
At O

have O
an O

overcome O
his O

over O

 O
The O
synchrony O
achieved O

allowed O
a O

 O
Because O
the O

in O

we O
performed O
a O

 O
Therefore O

we O

 O
Increasing O

been O
an O

 O
An O

the O

induces O

 O
However O
, O
weekly O

, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
our O

 O
Our O

 O
At O
that O
point O

the O

recommended O
stopping O

 O
The O
oncology O
department O
advised O
further O
testing O
to O
rule O
out O
ischemia O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
CMP O
as O
, O
in O
their O
opinion O
, O
chemotherapy O
with O
gemcitabine O
was O
the O
only O
option O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
recurrence O
in O
this O

 O
Two O

 O
The O

calculated O
to O
be O
around O
17 O

 O
Our O

 O
A O

and O
it O
showed O
improvement O
in O
systolic O
function O
with O
an O
LVEF O
of O
40 O
percent O
. O

 O
Due O
to O
his O
poor O
functional O
status O
and O
underlying O
CMP O
, O
further O
gemcitabine O
chemotherapy O
was O
stopped O
. O

 O
Later O

our O

developed O
a O

 O
Elevated O
PTH O

an O

primary O
hyperparathyroidism O

 O
Historically O
, O
hyperparathyroidism O
is O
associated O
with O
bone O
disease O
, O
renal O
stones O
and O
neuromuscular O
dysfunction O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
current O
screening O
modalities O
, O
most O
patients O
are O
caught O
early O
and O
often O
asymptomatic.3 O
Primary O
hyperparathyroidism O
is O
most O
commonly O
caused O
by O
a O
parathyroid O
adenoma O
. O

 O
Infrequent O
causes O
include O
parathyroid O
hyperplasia O
, O
which O
would O
affect O
all O
four O
glands O
and O
rarely O
caused O
by O
parathyroid O
carcinoma O
. O

 O
Markedly O
elevated O
serum O
PTH O
and O
calcium O
levels O
leading O
to O
severe O
renal O
and O
bone O
manifestations O
are O
helpful O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
cancer O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
usually O
discovered O
operatively O
based O
on O
local O
invasion O
and O

 O
The O
primary O
indication O
for O
parathyroidectomy O
, O
historically O
, O
is O
for O
symptomatic O
patients O

 O
Currently O
, O
since O
most O
patients O
are O
caught O
earlier O
, O
there O
are O
newer O
indications O
for O

. O

 O
These O
include O
an O

with O
any O

the O

This O
patient O
presented O
with O
pain O
, O
markedly O
elevated O
PTH O
, O
and O
was O
younger O
than O
50 O
  O
years O
old O
, O
so O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
surgery O
was O
the O
best O
choice O
in O
management O
. O

 O
The O
patient O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
and O
underwent O
a O
parathyroidectomy O
. O

 O
The O
surgeon O
found O
the O
parathyroid O
gland O
to O
be O
firm O
and O
densely O
adherent O
to O
the O
thyroid O
capsule O
and O
overlying O
strap O
muscle O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
dissect O
. O

 O
There O
was O
no O
visible O
invasion O
into O
the O
capsule O
, O
surrounding O
muscle O
or O
regional O
lymph O
nodes O
. O

 O
The O
resected O
specimen O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
brownish O
grey O
in O
colour O
with O
scattered O
necrotic O
foci O
, O
and O
irregular O
texture O
. O

 O
On O
postoperative O
pathology O
, O
the O
specimen O
was O
confirmed O
positive O
for O
parathyroid O
carcinoma O
with O
capsular O
invasion O
, O
focal O
tumour O
necrosis O
, O
reactive O
fibrosis O
and O
local O
skeletal O
muscle O
invasion O
( O
figures O

. O

 O
Margins O
were O
resected O
. O

 O
Immunohistochemical O

showed O
increased O
Ki-67 O

as O
well O
as O
strong O

the O

parathyroid O
carcinoma O
( O

. O

 O
Additionally O
, O
P57 O
staining O
was O
negative O
. O

 O
Although O
most O
reports O
of O
parathyroid O
carcinomas O
are O
associated O
with O
marked O
hypercalcaemia O
, O
non O
- O
functioning O
cancers O
in O
patients O
tend O
to O
behave O
more O
aggressively.1 O
Owing O
to O
the O
severity O
and O
uncertainty O
of O
the O
lesion O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
followed O
up O
postoperatively O
for O
repeat O
imaging O
to O
determine O
if O
residual O
tumour O
remained O
. O

 O
Repeat O
sestamibi O
and O
positron O
emission O
tomography O
( O
PET O
) O
scan O
revealed O
residual O
activity O
along O
the O
surgical O
area O
so O
the O
patient O
subsequently O
underwent O
a O
second O
operation O
for O
a O
radical O
left O
neck O
dissection O
and O
left O
hemithyroidectomy O
. O

 O
The O
patient O
recovered O
very O
well O
postoperatively O
and O
it O
has O
now O
been O
3 O
  O
years O
since O
the O
second O

. O

 O
The O
patient O
continues O
to O
do O
very O
well O
and O
is O
followed O
up O
every O
3 O
  O
months O
to O
monitor O
serum O
PTH O
and O
calcium O
levels O
. O

 O
She O
no O

 O
Sometimes O
the O

however O
, O
she O
remains O
eucalcaemic B
and O

continue O

 O
The O
patient O
will O
continue O

 O
These O
symptoms O
and O

waxed O
and O

but O
. O

 O
Our O
attention O
was O
piqued O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
patient O

family O
described O
the O
patient O
as O
an O
individual O
who O

 O
The O
patient O
had O
no O

 O
An O
external O

was O
located O
in O
the O
umbilical O
region O
with O
redness O
of O

skin O
. O

 O
Morphological O
examination O
indicated O
that O
fistula O
secretions O
mainly O
consisted O
of O
small O
intestinal O

. O

 O
The O
abdominal O

was O
soft O
, O
with O
no O

. O

 O
Bowel O

 O
Escherichia O

 O
Other O
findings O
from O

 O
A O

, O
although O
no O

detected O
( O

. O

 O
A O
presumptive O
diagnosis O
of O
was O
reached O
; O
this O
diagnosis O
was O
mainly O
based O
on O
digital O
radiography O
of O
the O
fistulous O
tract O
conducted O
using O
iopamidol-370 O
as O
a O
contrast O
agent O
. O

 O
This O
procedure O
was O
performed O
under O
local O
anaesthesia O
and O
revealed O
that O
the O
distal O
ileum O
approximately O
40 O
cm O
from O
the O
ileocaecal O
junction O
was O
entrapped O
( O

 O
The O
patient O
agreed O
to O

 O
She O
understood O
the O

factors O
and O
signed O
an O

 O
After O
bowel O
preparation O

the O
patient O
received O
an O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
. O

 O
The O
abdominal O

of O
the O
terminal O
ileum O
( O
approximately O
40 O

) O
was O
found O
entrapped O
in O
the O
internal O
hernia O

this O
finding O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
preoperative O

 O
The O
defect O
in O
the O
abdominal O

was O
less O
than O

and O
an O
extremely O

 O
During O
the O
attempts O
to O

the O
patient O
off O

in O
the O
following O
months O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
activate O
the O
inspiratory O
flow O

and O
required O
significant O
sedoanalgesia O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O

due O
to O
repeated O
episodes O
of O
desaturation O
, O
on O
some O
occasions O
with O
bradycardia O
, O
associated O
to O
bronchial O
collapse O
. O

 O
He O
continued O
to O
have O
asynchrony O
which O
required O
boluses O
of O
sedation O
in O
addition O
to O
existing O
medications O
. O

 O
He O
initially O
received O
fentanyl O

midazolam O
through O

in O

 O
As O
clinical O
stabilisation O
was O
achieved O
, O
the O
muscular O

was O
withdrawn O
and O
a O
progressive O
decrease O
of O
sedation O
was O
initiated O
along O
with O
a O
change O
in O
the O
drug O
regimen O
. O

 O
During O
this O
period O
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
an O
ocular O

which O
was O
attributed O
to O
a O
pharmacological O
cause O
after O

were O
ruled O
out O
with O

 O
At O
5 O
  O
months O
of O
age O
, O
the O
NAVA O

started O
to O
improve O
the O
patient O

adaptation O
to O
the O

through O
the O

 O
The O

according O
to O
the O

it O

 O
It O
was O

According O

not O
appear O
with O

and O
life O

is O
pretty O
long O
, O
so O
ethically O
, O
we O
considered O
that O
this O
patient O
should O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
overcome O
his O
thoracic O
insufficiency O
if O
it O
were O
technically O
possible O

 O
Tachypnoea O
was O
initially O
observed O
with O
a O

his O

eventually O
returned O
to O
normal O
for O
his O
age O
( O
40 O
) O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

 O
The O
synchrony O
achieved O
with O
the O
ventilator O
allowed O
a O
progressive O
decrease O
of O
the O
sedoanalgesia O
he O
received O
until O
it O
was O
completely O
withdrawn O
in O
10 O

; O
and O
the O
need O
for O

 O
Concurrently O

 O
A O
careful O
study O

suggested O
that O
this O

 O
After O

 O
Following O
discussion O
at O
a O
multidisciplinary O
team O

it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O

this O
mass O
as O
a O
chest O

Primary O
hyperparathyroidism O

causes O
