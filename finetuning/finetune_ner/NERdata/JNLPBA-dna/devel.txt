We O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
NF-microB-binding B
site I
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O
IgH B
enhancer I
, O
because O
mutation O

decreased O

of O
the O

in O
cells O

but O
not O
in O

This O
effect O
was O
comparable O
to O
or O
even O
stronger O
than O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
mutation O

the O
OCTA B

Moreover O
, O
combined O
mutation O

both O
microB B

further O
reduced O
enhancer O

that O

the O

abolished O

completely O

Nevertheless O
, O
a O

Our O

that O
the O

a O

for O

Here O

we O

This O
is O
the O
first O
demonstration O
of O
a O

The O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O

found O
on O
a O

Expression O

Deletion O

results O
in O
a O
failure O

Finally O

To O

we O
