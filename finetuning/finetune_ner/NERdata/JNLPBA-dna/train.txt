We O

That O

Recent O

Previous O

led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
common O
octamer B

is O
functionally O
important O
in O
the O
tissue-specific O

located O

which O

previously O

To O
further O
elucidate O
the O
role O

this O
variant O
octamer B
motif I
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
germline B

we O
have O
quantitated O
the O

determined O
the O

We O
find O
that O
, O

the O
variant O
octamer B

binds O
Oct-1 O

Oct-2 O
in O

with O
5-fold O
lower O

the O

mutation O

the O
variant O

either O

no O
effect O
on O

We O
also O
find O
significant O
differences O
in O
activation O
of O
germline B

V B

Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O

differ O
in O
their O
dependence O
on O

These O

Consequently O

the O

this O

revealed O
the O

Based O

we O
propose O
that O

An O

a O

The O
association O

20q B
deletions I

that O
the O

We O
have O

performed O
a O

molecular O

20q B

defined O
a O
commonly B
deleted I
region I

In O
each O
case O
, O
cytogenetic O
analysis O
had O
either O
failed O
or O
had O
shown O
no O
abnormalities O
of O
chromosome B
20 I
. O

Seventeen O
microsatellite B
markers I
that O
span O
the O
common O
deleted O
region O
were O
used O
to O
search O
for O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
in O
granulocyte B
DNA I
. O

No O

microsatellite O

was O
observed O
in O
a O
total O
of O
880 O
comparisons O
of O

T-cell I
DNA I
. O

Granulocyte O
DNA O
from O
four O
patients O
exhibited O
allele O
loss O
on O
20q B
. O

In O
each O
case O
the O
allele O
loss O
was O
caused O
by O
an O
interstitial O
deletion O
because O
heterozygosity O
at O
distal B
markers I
was O
retained O
and O
because O
quantitative O
Southern O

hemizygosity O

Our O
results O
therefore O
show O
that O
allele O
loss O
on O
chromosome B

polycythemia O

does O
not O
commonly O
involve O
mitotic O

A-myb B
was O

was O

In O

Finally O

we O
have O
studied O
the O
progression O

have O
found O
that O
the O

expressed O
about O
25-fold O
less O

the O
CLL O

The O

B-myb B
was O
clearly O
distinct O
from O
that O

C-myb O
and O
B-myb B
were O
expressed O
in O
all O

Thus O
, O
A-myb B

, O
unlike O
that O

c-myb B

B-myb B
, O
is O
restricted O
to O

BL O

of O
a O

This O
expression O
may O
in O

the O

In O

we O

the O

the O
recruitment O
of O

We O
find O
that O
recruitment O
of O
EKLF O
to O
5'HS2 B
requires O
the O
TATA B
box I
, O
but O
recruitment O
to O

depends O
on O
the O

Furthermore O
, O

only O
occurred O
in O

in O
both O

also O

We O
have O
also O
examined O
how O
one O
5'HS B
affects O
the O
recruitment O
of O
EKLF O

another O
5'HS B
. O

We O
have O
found O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
EKLF O
to O
5'HS3 B
depends O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
5'HS2 B
in O
cis O

but O
the O
recruitment O
to O
5'HS2 B
does O
not O
depend O
on O
5'HS3 B
. O

Based O
on O
these O
results O
, O
we O
present O
a O
model O
that O
illustrates O
how O
EKLF O
may O
be O
recruited O
to O

It O
is O
generally O
assumed O
that O
most O
mammalian B

are O
transcribed O
from O
both O
alleles B
. O

Hence O
, O
the O
diploid O
state O

the O
genome O
offers O
the O
advantage O
that O
a O
loss-of-function O
mutation O
in O
one O

can O
be O
compensated O
for O
by O
the O
remaining O
wild-type B

the O

Indeed O
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
human O

in O
the O

are O
recessive O

that O

is O
the O
'default O

This O

known O

has O

Recently O
we O

reported O
that O
the O
Pax5 B

is O
subject O
to O

during O
B O

development O

Pax5 O
is O
predominantly O

only O
one O
of O
its O
two O

in O
early O
B-lymphoid O
progenitors O
and O
mature O
B O

, O
while O
it O
transiently O
switches O
to O
a O
biallelic O
mode O
of O
transcription O
in O
pre-B O
and O
immature O
B O
cells O
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
B-lymphoid O
tissues O
are O
mosaic O
with O

to O
the O
transcribed O

and O
heterozygous O
mutation O
of O
Pax5 O
therefore O
results O
in O
deletion O
of O

expressing O
only O
the O

The O
allele B

Pax5 O
raises O
the O
intriguing O
possibility O
that O
monoallelic O

may O
also O
be O
the O
mechanism O

the O
haploinsufficiency O

These O
observations O

that O
a O

In O
this O

The O

Recently O

we O

In O
the O

we O
demonstrate O
that O

whereas O
the O

cooperate O
differently O
with O
the O

Because O
the O

we O
assessed O
the O
effect O
of O
the O

These O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O
TRE-like B

can O
mediate O
the O

Since O

we O
propose O
a O

The O

an O

the O

the O

The O

PU.1 I

likely O
accounts O
for O
both O

CD20 O
whereas O
the O
CD20 O
E O

the O

Among O

to O

whether O

These O

also O

In O

The O

The O

The O

The O

Using O

Thus O

a O

that O

Therefore O

We O

Although O

only O

( O

of O
the O
hepatitis B

( I

core I

contains O
three O
subregions O

One O
of O
these O

in O
both O

Here O
we O
show O
that O
the O
transcription O

can O
bind O

NRE B

transactivate O
the O

Mutations O

the O

In O
the O
absence O

, O
we O
hypothesize O
that O
RFX1 O
acts O
with O
MIBP1 O
to O
negatively O
regulate O
the O
core O
promoter O

through O
the O
NRE B

The O
ability O
of O
RFX1 O

transactivate O

raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
RFX1 O
may O
play O

our O

the O

Our O

We O

the O
hypothesis O
that O

We O
demonstrated O
the O

This O

represented O
a O

Here O
we O
show O
that O
the O

by O

We O
, O
therefore O

that O

the O

The O

However O
, O
it O

In O
addition O
, O
they O
suggested O
that O
the O
activation O

under O
the O
control O
of O
not O
only O
NFAT O

also O
a O

While O

, O
it O
was O
only O
partially O

that O
the O

Since O

the O

we O

To O

BACKGROUND O
: O
The O

( O

is O
a O
bi- O
or O

protein O
that O

and O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O

of O

. O

We O

that O

gene I
, O
coding O
for O
a O
protein O

the O

, O
acts O
as O
a O
potent O
dominant-negative O

of O

. O

We O
were O
, O
therefore O
, O
interested O
in O
examining O

for O
their O

for O
the O

RESULTS O
: O
In O
preliminary O

, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O

the O

full-length O
human O

resulted O
in O
strong O

thus O
establishing O
the O

of O
HTLV-I O
. O

We O
have O
conducted O
functional O
studies O
of O
the O
enhancer B
elements I
of O
human O
T-cell O
leukemia O
virus O
type O
I O
( O

are O

, O
and O
MT-2 O
and O
TL-Mor O
, O
which O
carry O
the O
proviral O
genome O
of O
HTLV-I O
. O

Two O
distinct O
elements O
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
function O
of O
the O
HTLV-I B
enhancer I
. O

One O
is O
the O
21-base-pair B
( I
bp I
) I
core I
element I
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
trans-activation O
by O
the O
HTLV-I O
trans-activator O
p40tax O
and O
that O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
bind O
to O
cyclic-AMP O
responsive O
element O
binding O
factor O
( O
CREB O
) O
-like O
factor O
( O
s O
) O
. O

The O
other O
is O
a O
region O
interposed O
between O
the O
21-bp B
elements I
. O

In O
this O
study O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
a O
subfragment O
( O
C26 O
) O
in O
the O
region O
between O
the O
21-bp B
elements I
is O
involved O
in O
trans-activation O
by O
p40tax O
, O
possibly O
through O
binding O
to O
an O
NF-kappa O
B-like O
nuclear O
factor O
or O
factors O
. O

The O
C26 B
element I
conferred O
partial O
responsiveness O
to O
p40tax O
when O
linked O
to O
one O
copy O
of O
the O
21-bp B
element I
that O
, O
by O
itself O
, O
showed O
little O
activation O
in O
response O
to O
p40tax O
. O

However O
, O
the O
C26 B
element I
alone O
, O
even O
when O
repeated O
, O
could O
not O
be O
activated O
by O
p40tax O
, O
unlike O
other O
NF-kappa B
B-binding I
elements I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
C26 B
element I
itself O
was O
profoundly O
activated O
upon O
stimulation O
with O
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate O
. O

These O
findings O
therefore O
suggest O
that O
the O
HTLV-I B
enhancer I
contains O
multiple B
functional I
elements I
, O
including O
binding O
sites O
for O
at O
least O
CREB- O
and O
NF-kappa O
B-like O
factors O
, O
which O
synergistically O
cooperate O
in O
activation O
of O
the O
HTLV-I B
enhancer I
in O
response O
to O
p40tax O
. O

Our O
results O
also O
demonstrate O
that O
TPA-dependent O
activation O
of O
the O
HTLV-I B
enhancer I
may O
be O
mediated O
through O
the O
C26 B
element I
. O

Human B

are O
highly O

rhombotin B

encode O
two O

The O

not O
on O
chromosome O

but O
also O
retains O

the O
LIM B
domain I

Since O
the O

such O
a O

the O

A O

Therefore O

chromosome B

The O

define O
the O

a O
class O

T-cell B

The O

The O
Thy-1 B

a O

that O
it O

Using O

we O
show O
that O
this O

any O

It O

We O

Our O
results O
show O
that O
the O

The O

Mutations O

The O

Thus O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
T-cell-specific O
activation O

the O
proenkephalin B

NF-kappa O

However O
, O
as O
NF-kappa O
B O
is O

the O

through O
the O

is O
T O
cell O

yet O
another O
T-cell-specific O

which O
synergizes O

NF-kappa O
