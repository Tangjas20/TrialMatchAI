To O

we O
identified O
within O
the O

This O

an O

However O

it O
remains O

whether O

Pax5 B

Thus O

indicating O
that O
the O

Thus O
, O
the O

sufficient O
for O

MATERIALS O

METHODS O
: O
Human O
p45 O
mRNAs O
have O
two O
alternative O

aNF-E2 O

fNF-E2 O
, O
and O

For O

Functional O

The O

We O

which O

Thus O

the O

Here O
we O

We O

We O
also O
observed O
that O
