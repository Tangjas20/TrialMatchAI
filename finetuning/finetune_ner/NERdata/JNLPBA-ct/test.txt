RESULTS O
: O
Lymphocytes B

The O

Despite O
the O

These O

Due O

We O

We O

Exogenous O
IL-10 O
inhibits O
NF-kappaB O

We O

the O

the O
regulation O

Dendritic B

from O

progenitors I

Dendritic B
cells I
( O
DCs B
) O
are O
professional O
antigen-presenting B
cells I
which O
both O
initiate O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
and O
control O
tolerance O
to O
self-antigens O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
these O
different O
effects O
on O
responder O
cells O
depend O
on O
subsets O
of O
DCs B
arising O
from O
either O
myeloid O
or O
lymphoid O
hematopoietic O
origins O
. O

In O
this O
model O
, O
CD8 B
alpha+ I
Mac-1- I
DCs I
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
of O
lymphoid O
while O
CD8 B
alpha- I
Mac-1+ I
DCs I
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
of O
myeloid O
origin O
. O

Here O
we O
summarize O
our O
findings O
that O
both O
CD8 B
alpha+ I
and I
CD8 I
alpha- I
DCs I
can O
arise O
from O
clonogenic B
common I
myeloid I
progenitors I
( O
CMPs B
) O
in O
both O
thymus O
and O
spleen O
. O

Therefore O
CD8 O
alpha O
expression O
DCs B
does O
not O
indicate O
a O
lymphoid O
origin O
and O
differences O
among O
CD8 B
alpha+ I
and I
CD8 I
alpha- I
DCs I
might O
rather O
reflect O
maturation O
status O
than O
ontogeny O
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
transplantation O

, O
it O
seems O
likely O
that O
most O
of O
the O
DCs B
in O
secondary O
lymphoid O
organs O
and O
a O
substantial O
fraction O
of O
thymic B
DCs I
are O

Here O

we O

It O
was O

whether O

exert O

Although O

a O

not O
with O
the O
oestrogen O

To O
investigate O
whether O
the O
observed O
thymolytic O
effects O
were O
due O
to O
the O

thymocytes B

cells O
were O
isolated O

measure O

Several O
techniques O
were O
used O
to O
determine O
thymocyte B

no O

Using O

, O
no O

Therefore O
, O
upon O

To O
study O
the O

, O
androgen O

treated O

No O

that O
changes O

the O

Our O

The O

was O
to O
determine O

MATERIALS O

METHODS O
: O

with O
anti-CD2 O
antibodies O
or O

bearing O
the O
natural O
CD2 O

, O
after O
which O

. O

RESULTS O
: O
Stimulation O

leads O
to O
the O
tyrosine O

, O
nuclear O

of O
STAT1 O

This O
pathway O
appears O
to O
be O
restricted O
to O
T B

, O
as O
stimulation O
of O
CD2 O
on O
NK B

not O
lead O

. O

CONCLUSION O
: O
Stimulation O
of O
T B
cells I
through O
cell-surface O
molecules O
such O
as O

involves O
activation O
of O
STAT O

, O
thus O

of O

. O

Doubly O

Thus O

dispensable O
for O

CONCLUSION O
: O
Arthritis O

IL-1 O

at O

partially O
on O
RelB O
, O

not O
on O

. O

IL-1 O
contributes O
to O
leukocyte O

the O

directly O
induces O

Our O

demonstrate O
that O
RARalpha O

dispensable O
for O
granulopoiesis O

as O
RARalpha O
( O

mice O
have O
a O

despite O
an O

Furthermore O
, O
endogenous O
retinoids O
control O
granulopoiesis O
in O

, O
as O
either O
vitamin O
A-deficient O
mice O
or O
animals O
treated O
with O
an O
RAR O

accumulate O
more O
immature B

Conversely O
, O
RARalpha O
acts O
to O
limit O
differentiation O
in O

because O
granulocyte B

Thus O

These O

We O

We O

that O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Eosinophils B
are O
now O
known O
to O
produce O
a O
variety O
of O
proinflammatory O
cytokines O
, O
although O
the O
molecular O
factors O
that O
regulate O
their O
production O
are O
poorly O
understood O
. O

The O
expression O
of O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
cytokines O
produced O
by O
eosinophils B
, O
including O
the O
proallergic O
cytokine O
IL-4 O
, O
is O
now O
known O
to O
be O
regulated O
at O
the O
level O
of O
transcription O
by O
members O
of O
the O
nuclear O
factor O
of O
activated O
T O
cells O
( O
NFAT O
) O
family O
of O
transcription O
factors O
. O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
We O
sought O
to O
characterize O
the O
expression O
of O
different O
NFAT O
proteins O
in O
resting B
and I
activated I
eosinophils I
. O

METHODS O
: O
Nuclear O
and O
whole O
cell O
extracts O
were O
obtained O
from O
both O
peripheral B
blood I
eosinophils I
and O
those O
obtained O
from O
bronchoalveolar O
lavage O
fluid O
of O
asthmatic O
subjects O
after O
endobronchial O
allergen O
challenge O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
Both O
peripheral B
blood I
and I
bronchoalveolar I
lavage I
fluid I
eosinophils I
expressed O
NFATp O
and O
NFATc O
protein O
. O

Unlike O
activated B
T I
cells I
, O
which O
express O
multiple O
NFATc O
isoforms O
, O
eosinophils B
preferentially O
express O
the O
approximately O
85-kd O
isoform O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
eosinophils B
were O
found O
to O
constitutively O
express O
NFATc O
mRNA O
. O

CONCLUSION O
: O
NFATp O
and O
NFATc O
can O
regulate O
the O
expression O
of O
cytokines O
and O
other O
genes O
in O
eosinophils B
but O
appear O
to O
be O
regulated O
by O
a O
novel O
signal O

mechanism O
in O
these O
cells O

Our O

provide O
