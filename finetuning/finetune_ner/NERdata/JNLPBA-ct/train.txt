Epstein-Barr O
virus O
( O

is O
known O
to O
infect O
B B

We O
and O
others O
have O
shown O
that O
EBV O
can O
also O
infect O
a O
subset O

Infection O

was O
accompanied O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O

within O
8 O

This O
is O
in O

to O
the O

in O

where O
the O
genome O
can O
circularize O
within O
24 O

was O
also O
identified O
in O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
EBNA-1 O

was O
transcribed O
from O
the O

rather O
than O

These O
observations O
suggest O
that O

EBV O

of O
thymocytes B
differs O
from O
infection O

The O
main O

is O
that O

no O

that O

Our O

Here O

we O

that O

of O
human O
purified O

that O
PU.1 O

upregulated O
as O
an O
early O
event O
during O

PU.1 O

PU.1 O
is O
expressed O
at O
highest O
levels O
in O
mature B
human I

In O
contrast O
to O
PU.1 O
, O
significant O
levels O
of O
Spi-B O
mRNA O

are O
found O
only O
in O

Therefore O
, O
although O

bind O

similar O
DNA O
control O
elements O

have O

, O
the O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
In O

we O
show O
that O
human B

erythroid I
progenitors I
are O
distinct O
in O

and O
that O

occurs O
at O
a O
very O
early O

. O

Our O

that O
under O

occur O
in O

Since O

these O

Based O

we O
propose O
that O

These O

a O

To O

we O

the O

Sialoadhesin O

the O
Ig O

that O
mediates O

We O

the O

Sialoadhesin O

Finally O

Comparison O

that O

we O

MTHC O
in O
the O

differentiate O

When O
the O

exposed O

the O

Thus O

We O

the O
utility O

the O
relationships O

Although O

To O

Furthermore O

our O

that O

plays O
a O
role O
in O
LPS-induced O
NF-kappaB O

thus O
could O
be O
a O

BACKGROUND O
: O
We O
reported O
on O
the O
constitutive O

) O
expression O
on O
eosinophils B

But O
signal O

remains O
to O

. O

In O
this O

, O
we O
examined O
the O

of O

in O
the O
signaling O
of O

METHODS O
: O
Purified B

were O
stimulated O
with O
IFN-gamma O
at O
37 O
degrees O
C O
for O
1-60 O

. O

RESULTS O
: O
We O
show O
that O
binding O
of O
IFN-gamma O
to O
human B
eosinophils I
initiated O
a O
series O
of O
events O
that O
resulted O
in O

also O

CONCLUSION O
: O
These O
data O
indicate O
that O
IFN-gamma O
affects O
eosinophils B
through O
its O
specific O
receptor O
and O
utilizes O
the O
Jak/Stat O

as O
its O
mode O

that O

Unexpectedly O

we O
observed O
that O
an O

induces O

. O

In O
contrast O
, O
in O
the O
more O
immature O
, O
multipotent O
EML B

we O
observed O
that O
this O
RXR O

either O
in O
potentiating O
IL-3 O

we O
observed O
at O
these O

when O

Although O

a O

In O
this O

we O
show O
that O
the O
functional O
synergy O
between O
IL-12 O

IL-2 O
in O

correlates O
with O

these O

that O
the O

The O

We O
previously O

that O

Fetal B

We O

We O
conclude O
that O

we O

the O

A O

Consequently O

these O

Here O
the O

we O

the O

Flow O

Collectively O

these O

suggest O
that O
the O

STAT3 O

We O
now O
show O
that O

a O

Our O
results O
show O
that O

not O
constitutive O
in O

can O
be O

We O
show O
that O
H-7-sensitive O

These O

thus O
show O
that O

We O

We O
therefore O

Both O

is O
considerably O

The O

in O

is O
inhibited O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Cytokines O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
We O
investigated O
the O
production O

chemotactic O
factor O
for O
eosinophils B

. O

METHODS O
: O
Allergen-specific O
T O

were O
established O
from O
the O
peripheral B

and O
the O

determined O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
After O
nonspecific O

, O
IL-5 O
production O
by O
CD4+ B
T I
cells I
from O
both O
atopic O
and O

was O
significantly O
enhanced O

produced O
IL-5 O
after O
incubation O
with O

, O
suggesting O
that O
mite-specific B

were O
involved O
in O
the O

CONCLUSION O
: O
Enhanced O

The O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Recent O
studies O
have O
raised O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
glucocorticoids O
could O
diminish O
the O
ability O
of O
endothelial B
cells I
to O
direct O
leukocyte O
traffic O
into O
inflamed O
tissues O
by O
inhibiting O
expression O
of O
the O
adhesion O
molecules O
endothelial-leukocyte O
adhesion O
molecule-1 O
and O
intercellular O
adhesion O
molecule-1 O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
glucocorticoids O
also O
regulate O
the O
expression O
of O
L-selectin O
and O
CD11/CD18 O
integrins O
on O
human B
neutrophil I
granulocytes I

While O

did O
not O

of O
adhesion O

on O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Our O
results O
show O
that O
glucocorticoids O
at O
clinically O
relevant O
concentrations O
exert O
specific O
actions O
on O
expression O
of O
adhesion O

on O

which O
are O

through O
ligation O
of O

and O

and O
suggest O
a O
novel O
mechanism O

both O

although O
the O

slightly O
different O

The O

In O

a O
slight O

whereas O

A O
1-kb O

Further O

has O
revealed O
that O
this O

in O
MNDA O

non-expressing B

No O
significant O

was O
detected O
in O

that O
is O
induced O
by O

however O
, O
the O

In O

that O

Ehrlichia O
chaffeensis O

an O
obligatory O
intracellular O

that O
infects O
monocytes B

and O
is O
the O
etiologic O
agent O
of O
human O
ehrlichiosis O
in O
the O
United O

. O

Our O
previous O
studies O
showed O
that O
the O
exposure O
of O
human B
monocytes I
to O
E. O
chaffeensis O
induces O
the O
expression O
of O
interleukin-1beta O
( O
IL-1beta O
) O

not O
the O

In O
this O

, O
the O
effect O
of O
anti-E. O
chaffeensis O
antibody O
complexed O
with O
E. O
chaffeensis O
on O
the O
expression O
of O
major O
proinflammatory O

in O
human B

examined O
. O

This O
pattern O
of O
STAT O

is O
identical O
to O
IL-10 O
receptor O
activation O
on O
normal B
cells I

similar O
to O

STAT3 O
) O
and O
IFN-gamma O
( O

This O

requires O
regions O

SLP-76 O
that O
mediate O
protein-protein O
interactions O
with O
other O

in O
T B

suggesting O
that O
SLP-76 O

also O
function O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
SLP-76 O
recruits O
a O

as O

Certain O
subpopulations O

that O
prolactin O
can O
act O
as O
an O
autocrine O
and/or O
paracrine O
factor O
to O
modulate O
the O

The O

all O

a O
highly O
regulated O
process O

successive O
stages O

During O
myelopoiesis O
, O
which O
includes O
the O
development O
of O
granulocytic B

Few O
of O
these O
factors O
are O
expressed O
exclusively O
in O
myeloid B
cells I
; O
instead O
it O
appears O
that O
they O
cooperatively O
regulate O
transcription O

myeloid-specific O

. O

Phagocytosis O
represents O
an O
important O
physiological O
trigger O
for O
the O
inducible O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
in O
human B

Here O
, O
we O
report O
that O
a O
DNA-binding O
activity O
primarily O
consisting O
of O
the O
classical O
NF-kappa O
B O
heterodimer O
, O
p50/RelA O
, O
is O
induced O
in O
phagocytosing B
neutrophils I
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
NF-kappa O
B O
activation O
could O
constitute O
one O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
whereby O
the O
expression O
of O
kappa O
B-responsive O

is O
enhanced O
in O
phagocytosing B

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
represents O
the O
first O
demonstration O
that O
phagocytic O
stimuli O
can O
induce O
NF-kappa O

in O
human B

Because O

are O
common O
in O
human O

( O

persons O

the O

Cryptococcus O
neoformans O

Candida O

Thus O
, O
C. O
neoformans O

C. O

enhance O
HIV O

through O
a O
TNF-alpha- O

In O

The O

In O

However O

These O

that O

that O

such O

We O
therefore O
investigated O
whether O

physically O

To O
our O

this O

To O
overcome O
the O

we O
studied O
the O

The O

that O

necessary O
for O
the O

These O

that O

a O

that O

that O

We O

Because O

Altogether O
our O

Because O
