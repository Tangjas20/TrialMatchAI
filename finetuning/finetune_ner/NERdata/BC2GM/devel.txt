CONCLUSIONS: O
Although O
binding B
motifs I
and O
actual O
HLA O
binding O
can O
be O
detected O
in O
several O
cases, O
the O
generation O
of O
a O
cellular O
response O
is O
infrequent, O
confirming O
that O
HLA O
binding O
is O
necessary O
but O
not O
sufficient O
to O
obtain O
an O
in O
vitro O
response. O

The O
constitutive O
NF-kappa B
B I
appears O
to O
be O
functionally O
active, O
since O
a O
low O
level O
of O
tumour O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF) O
transcript O
is O
detectable O
in O
monocytes, O
and O
this O
level O
can O
be O
increased O
by O
blocking O
transcript O
degradation O
using O
cycloheximide. O

The O
Id O
family O
of O
helix-loop-helix B
proteins I
function O
as O

regulators O
of O
DNA O

basic O
helix-loop-helix O

in O
the O

of O

and O

Higher O
concentrations O
of O

beta(25-35) I
were O
effective O
by O
themselves O
in O
inducing O
NF-kappa B

activation, O
both O
in O
the O
N9 O
microglial O
cell O
line O
and O
in O
rat O
primary O
microglia, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
human O
monocytes. O

DNA O
binding O
specificity O
of O
complex O
3 O
overlaps O
with O
that O
of O
upstream B
stimulatory I
factor I
but O
is O
clearly O
distinct. O

By O
using O
mutated O
promoter-PLAP O
plasmids, B
we O
established O
that O
these O
NF-kappa B
B I
sites O
were O
necessary O
for O
induction O
of O
TNF-alpha B
transcription O
on O
stimulation O
with O
LPS. O

Moreover, O
IL-4 B
costimulation O
with O
IL-2 B
or O
IL-12 B
does O
not O
alter O
their O
own O

when O
C O
epsilon-, O

gamma O
RI-, O
and O

are O

suggesting O
that O
induction O
of O
GAS-like B
DNA-protein I
binding I
complexes I
by O
IL-2, O
IL-4, O
and O
IL-12 O
is O
highly O
selective O
and O
represents O
one O
important O
factor O
in O
determining O
specific O
gene O
activation. O

The O
addition O
of O
CD27 O
ligand O
(CD70) O
transfectants O
to O
B O
cell O

increased O
the O
IgE B

synergistically O
in O
the O

of O
IL-4 B
plus O
anti-CD40 B

(anti-CD40). O

Furthermore, O
compounds O
such O

proinflammatory B
cytokines, I
such O
as O
TNF-alpha, B
and O

Furthermore, O
we O
present O
a O
new O
principle O
for O
searching O
Ag B

potential O

Production O
of O

the O

Moreover, O
the O

of O

could O
be O
reproduced O
by O

whereas O
IFN-beta B

were O
required O
simultaneously O
with O

Also, O

We O
conclude O
that O
CBP, B
a O

plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
transcription O
of O

This O
zinc-finger B

which O

DNA O
in O

manner, O
is O
similar O
(greater O

80% O

to O
two O
previously O

Interleukin-12 B
(IL-12) O
is B
a O
cytokine B
that O
exhibits O
pleiotropic O

on O

and O
natural O

and O
has O
been O
shown O
to O

Although O

the O

of O
anti-CD28 B
MoAb, B
neonatal O

The O
sophisticated O

These O

that O

In O

The O

In O

However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O

Interleukin-5 B

These O

suggest O
that O
IL-2 B

induce O
assembly O

a O

and O
that O

Although O
these O

there O

In O

We O

Finally, O

The O

has O
been O
suggested O
through O

In O

this O

which O

Therefore, O
the O

Immunoprecipitation O

that O

these O
circumstances, O
Calphostin O

inhibited O
the O

whereas O
Staurosporine O
allowed O

but O
inhibited O

This O
suggested O
that O

which O
was O
upstream O

Together, O
these O

show O
that O

We, O
therefore, O
conclude O
that O

By O

we O

that O

There O

We O

from O

that, O

In O
this O

we O
investigated O
the O

using O

Lineage-specific O
activation O
of O

in O
human O

The O
transmembrane O

are O
well O

but O
there O
is O
striking O
sequence O
divergence O
of O
the O
carboxy-terminal B

essential O
for O
B-cell O

and O
interaction O

Such O

play O
a O
key O

in O
the O
development O
of O
the O
mature O
T-cell O

by O
functioning O
as O
'master O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
suppression O

is O
a O
mechanism O
by O
which O
oxidative O

inhibits O
FasL B

in O
activated O

and O
further O
support O
the O

that O

be O
required O
for O

under O

conditions. O

Phorbol O
activation O
was O
positively O
modulated O
by O

while O
TNF B

not. O

In O

We O

Consistent O
with O

we O
observed O

Moreover, O
integrin-ligand B
interactions O
trigger O

that O

The O

Therefore, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
determine O
whether O
CD14 B

and O
to O
define O
the O

Finally, O
the O
inhibition O
of O

by O
the O

could O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O

The O
detection O
of O

correlates O
with O
the O

of O
the O

this O

previously O

to O
be O
efficiently O
recognized O
by O

This O
contrasts O
with O
induction O
of O

by O
both O
CD40 B

which O
is O

and O
indicates O
that O

A O

Of O

the O

A O

in O
the O

of O
the O

for O
a O
concurrence O
of O
two O
disorders: O
xeroderma O

(XP) O
and O

(CS). O

These O
findings O
have O
suggested O
that O
cysteine B

might O
be O

in O
the O

that O
the O

In O

However, O
during O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
LPS-induced O
NF-kappaB B
activation O
and O
TNF-alpha B
release O
in O
human O
monocytes O
are O
independent O
of O
PKC B

This O

immunologically O
distinct O
from O

Additionally, O

not O

Several O

participate O
in O
IL-2 B

activation, O
among O
which O
are O
AP-1-like B

From O

analysis, O
two O
of O
these O
appear O
to O

novel O

sites, O
whereas O
the O
third O
was O
identified O
as O
a O
cyclic O

(CRE). O

We O
present O
data O
to O
show O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
TNF B
alpha I
is O
regulated O
by O
the O
transcription B

C/EBP B
beta I
(NF-IL6). O

We O
conclude O
that O
soluble O

inhibit O

respectively, O
and O
neither O

a O

The O

high O
and O

Analysis O

Thus, O

Finally, O

Finally, O

However, O
the O

However, O

These O

It O

Thus, O

These O

indicate O
that O
HIV-1 B

We O

The O

In O

Although O

Since O

These O

The O

Inasmuch O
as O
these O

In O

These O

that, O
among O

the O

To O

Recently, O
we O
and O
others O
have O
shown O
that O
thrombopoietin B
induces O
rapid O
tyrosine B
phosphorylation O
of O
Jak2 B
and O
other O
proteins O
in O
human O
platelets O
and O
BaF3 O
cells, O
genetically O
engineered O
to O
express O
c-Mpl, B
a O
receptor O
for O
thrombopoietin. O

The O
32Dcl3 O
cells O
are O
IL-3-dependent B
for O
growth O
and O
they O
differentiate O
into O
granulocytes O
when O
exposed O
to O
G-CSF. B

A O
factor O
that O
regulates O
the O
class O
II O
major O
histocompatibility O
complex O
gene O
DPA O
is O
a O
member O
of O
a O
subfamily O
of O
zinc B
finger I

that O
includes O
a O
Drosophila B
developmental I

protein. I

Since O
the O
IRF-1 B
gene O
is O
both O
virus O
and O
IFN B
inducible, O
an O
intriguing O
issue O
is O
raised O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
IRF-1 O
gene O
is O
functioning O
in O
IFN-mediated O
regulation O
of O
cell O
growth O
and O
differentiation. O

Glucocorticoid B
receptors I
(GR) O
are B
ubiquitous O
molecules O
and O
are O
present O
also O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
and O
in O
several O
other O
nervous O
and O
immune O
tissues. O

One O
gene O
of O
interest O
is O
the O
glycoprotein O
IIb O
(GPIIb) O
gene; O
GPIIb, O
the O
alpha B
subunit I
of O
the O
platelet B
cytoadhesin I
GPIIb-IIIa, I
is O
produced O
in O
megakaryocytes O
at O
an O
early O
stage O
of O
the O
differentiation, O
whereas O
the O
other O
subunit O
of O
this O
complex, O
GPIIIa, B
is O
expressed O
in O
other O
cells. O

Associated O
with O
the O
inhibition O
of O
the O
cell O
cycle, O
IL-10 B
suppressed O
SEB B
induction O
of O
interleukin-2 B
(IL-2). O

The O
balance O
between O
type O
1 O
and O
2 O
T O
helper O
cell O
cytokine B
production O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
several O
animal O
models O
of O
autoimmunity, O
and O
skewed O
patterns O
of O
cytokine O
expression O
have O
been O
described O
in O
human O
inflammatory O
diseases. O

Furthermore, O
IL-18-induced B
activation O
of O
NF-kappaB B
and O
c-Jun B
N-terminal I
kinase I
(JNK) O
is B
blocked O
in O
MyD88-/- B
Th1-developing O
cells. O

The O
purified O
NF-GM2 B
activated O
in O

transcription O
from O
the O

while O
it O
failed O
to O
stimulate O
transcription O
from O
the O
GM-CSF O

harboring O
the O

sequence. O

NK O
cells O
induce O

on O
the O
surface O

in O
an O
adhesion-dependent, O
IFN-gamma-independent B
manner. O

Selective O
regulation O
of O
IL-5 B
gene O
transcription O
may O
be O
useful O
for O
treating O
eosinophlic O
inflammation. O

Eed B
binds O
to O
K B
protein I
through O
a O
domain O
in O
its O
N B
terminus, I
but O
interestingly, O
this O
domain O
is O
not O
found O
in O
the O
Drosophila O
Esc. B

The O
induction O
of O
cytokine B
expression O
in O
monocytes/macrophages O
by O
bacterial B
endotoxin I
or O
lipopolysaccharide O
is O
a O
critical, O
highly O
regulated O
host O
defence O
response. O

Induction O
of O
CD38 B
in O
acute O
promyelocytic O
and O
acute O
myeloblastic O
leukemia O
cells O
was O
independent O
of O
ATRA-induced O
cytodifferentiation. O

We, O
therefore, O
compared O
the O
activation O
state O
of O
the O
IL-2 B
gene O
promoter O
region O
in O
freshly O
isolated O
and O
stimulated O
Ipr O
CD4-8- O
T O
cells O
with O
that O
of O
normal O
T O
lymphocytes. O

These O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
Stat3 B
but O
not O
Stat1 B
or O
Stat5 B
is O
directly O
recruited O
to O
the O
ligand-activated B
IL-10 I
receptor I
by O
binding O
to O
specific O
but O
redundant O
receptor B
intracellular B
domain I
sequences I
containing O
phosphotyrosine. B

Cloned, O
normal O
T O
lymphocytes O
show O
very O
little, O
if O
any, O
basal O
activity O
of O
the O
HIV B

and O
low O
nuclear O
expression O
of O
NF-kappa B
B, I
a O
potent B
transcriptional I
activator I
of O
the O
HIV O
enhancer. O

Taken O
together, O
these O
findings O
suggest O
that O
PWM B
is O
able O
to O
initiate O
an O
intracytoplasmic O
signalling O
cascade O
and O
EGR-1 O
induction O
in O
normal O
human O

cells. O

The O
Oct-2 B
transcription I

is O
a O
member O

the O

factors I
and O
is O
expressed O
only O
in O
B O
lymphocytes O
and O
in O
neuronal O

but O
not O
in O
other O
cell O
types. O

Unresponsiveness O
to O
gamma B
interferon I
for O
activation O
of O
this O
pathway O
may O
explain O
impaired O
transcriptional O
responses O
in O
leishmania-infected O
cells. O

Finally, O
the O
addition O
of O
anti-CD28 B
mAb I
to O
anti-CD3 O
mAb-stimulated O
T O
cells O
overcame O
much O
of O
the O
suppression O
of O
proliferation O
induced O
by O
PGE2 O
or O
ISO O
but O
less O
so O
than O
that O
induced O
by O
DEX. O

Interleukin-12 B
(IL-12) O
is B
a O
key O
inducer O
of O
differentiation O
of O
uncommitted O
T O
helper O
(TH) O
cells O
toward O
the O
TH1 O
phenotype, O
which O
regulates O
cellular O
immunity, O
whereas O
IL-10 B
inhibits O
TH1 O
functions O
and O
potentiates O
TH2-regulated O
responses O
(i.e., O
humoral O
immunity). O

Our O
results O
show O
that O
the O
structure O
of O
this O
promoter O
only O
permits O
productive O
interactions O
of O
the O
two O
transcription B
factors I
Sp1 B
and O
CP1 B
with O
the O
basal O

in O
the O

Nuclear B

The O

Recent O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
p53 B

appears O
in O
two O
different O
forms: O
the O
mutant B
p53 I
that O
stimulates O
tumor O

type I
p53 I
that O

It O
has O
been O
recently O
claimed O

Transcriptional O

Using O
human O
B- O
or O
T-cell O
lines O
transfected O

we O
demonstrate O
that O
a O

the O

of O
HHV-6 B
transactivation. O

Interactions O
between O
the O

In O
this O

we O
examined O
seven O

from O
which O

on O
the O

benefit. O

In O
the O

we O
investigated O
whether O
aberrancies O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
c-fos/c-jun O
at O

might O
underlie O
the O

Platelet B

Moreover, O

classified O

T-ALL O
based O

that O
an O
additional O
event O
is O
required O
for O
malignant O

cells O
expressing O
E2A-HLF. B

Although O
a O
role O
of O
p16 B
in O
this O
regulation O
has O
been O
presumed, O
there O
is O
no O
proof O
so O
far O
that O
loss O
of O
this O
tumor O
suppressor O
gene O
really O
affects O
E2F-mediated B
regulations. O

Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
p24rex B
of O
HTLV-II B
is O
not O
initiated O
at O
an O
internal O
AUG O
and O
that O
the O
internal O

are O
not O
crucial O
to O
the O
function O
of O
the O

and, O
ultimately, O
the O
transforming O

Recently, O
we O
have O
reported O
that O
the O
histogenesis O

be O
assessed O
by O
monitoring O
the O

To O

a O

we O
fused O
the O

The O

directly O
demonstrated O
by O

and O
mutation O
of O
potential O

reduced O

Thus, O
despite O
its O
essential O

an O

Tat B
is O
not O
otherwise O
absolutely O
required O

RA O

appears O
critical O
to O

These O

are O

with O
a O

in O
which O
binding O

LAM B

While O
ICN B
appeared O
primarily O
in O
the O

DeltaE B
localized O
to O

suggesting O
that O

not O
essential O
for O

Two O

which O
differed O
strikingly O
in O
their O
ability O

Furthermore, O

Therefore, O

The O

We O
focused O
our O

on O
the O
role O

Pit-1 B

CONCLUSION: O
Overall, O
the O

Because O

we O

A O
major O

from O
the O

To O

The O

inhibited O
completely O
by O

either O

thus O
indicating O
that O
the O

due O
to O
a O

Pretreatment O

that O
a O

a O

Collectively, O

On O

we O
propose O
that O

a O

These O

support O
the O
view O
that O

induce O
some O

suggest O
that O
this O

that O

we O

Taken O

them. O

That O
synergy O
of O

pathways O
is O
relevant O
for O
the O
anti-Ig B

is O
supported O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
cAMP-inducing O
agents O

enhance O

The O

that O

We O

that O
the O

to O
play O
an O
important O

and O
their O

consequences. O

The O
production O
of O
human B
immunodeficiency I
virus I
type I
1 I
(HIV-1) I
progeny B
was O
followed O
in O
the O
U937 O
promonocytic O
cell O
line O
after O
stimulation O
either O
with O
retinoic O
acid O
or O
PMA, O
and O
in O
purified O
human O
monocytes O
and O
macrophages. O

We O
have O
isolated O
a O
human O
cDNA O
clone O
encoding O
a O
zinc B
finger I
protein I
(NF-E1) O
that B
binds O
to O
the O
negative-acting O
segment O
of O
the O
kappa O
E3' O
enhancer. O

Because O
STAT6 B
activation O
plays O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
IL-4/IL-13-induced B
gene B
expression, O
the O
ability O
of O
IFN-beta B
and O
IFN-gamma B
to O
inhibit O
STAT6 O
activity O
provides O
an O
explanation O
for O
how O
IFNs B
can O
suppress O
IL-4/IL-13-inducible O
gene O
expression. O

Thus, O
we O
also O
determined O
the O
effects O
of O
TS O
on O
NFkappaB. B

NF-kappa B
B I
activation O
by O
TNF B
alpha I
was O
not O
correlated O
with O
cell O
differentiation O
or O
proliferation. O

By O
using O
PD98059, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 O
pathway B
did O
not O
affect O
the O
DNA O
binding O
of O
NF-kappa B
B I
but, O
rather, O
acted O
at O
the O
level O
of O
transcriptional O
activity O
of O
NF-kappa O
B. O

Nuclear B
factor I
of I
activated I
T I
cells I
(NF-AT) O
is B
a O
transcriptional B
activator I
involved O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
IL-2 B
gene O
expression. O

Induction O
of O
apoptosis O
in O
lymphocytes, O
which O
may O
account O
for O
the O
therapeutic O
effects O
of O
glucocorticoids O
in O
various O
diseases O
including O
leukemia, O
depends O
on O
the O
glucocorticoid B
receptor. I

The O
GCR B
binding O
affinity O
for O
budesonide O
was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
both O
groups O
(i.e., O
lower O
dissociation O
constant) O
than O
that O
obtained O
for O
dexamethasone. O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
IL-12 B
induces O
STAT4 B
only O
in O
freshly O
isolated O
primary O
NK O
cells, O
but O
not O
in O
primary O
T O
cells, O
consistent O
with O
the O
lack O
of O
the O
IL-12 B
receptor I
in O
resting O
T O
cells. O

Although O
little O
information O
as O
to O
what O
signal O
transduction O
pathways O
mediate O
NF-kappa B
B I
activation O
in O
monocytes-macrophages O
is O
available, O
our O
previous O
work O
indicated O
that O
classical O
protein B
kinase I
C I
(PKC) I
isoenzymes B
were O
not O
involved O
in O
the O
HIV-mediated B
NF-kappa O
B O
activation. O

In O
addition, O
this O
TR2RE-SV40 O
can B
function O
as O
a O
repressor O
to O
suppress O
the O
transcriptional O
activities O
of O
both O
SV40 O
early O
and O
late O
promoters. O

The O
differences O
between O
wild-type B
and I
mutated I
receptors I
in O
the O
induction O
of O
apoptosis O
were O
not O
related O
to O
levels O
of O
p56(lck) B
or O
NF- B
kappaB I
activation. O

In O
contrast, O
interleukin-1beta-converting O
enzyme O
family O
protease O
inhibitors O
Ac-DEVD-CHO O
and O
CrmA O
blocked O
Fas-mediated B
apoptosis. O

Strikingly, O
deletion O
of O
346 B
C-terminal I
residues I
augmented O
this O
activity, O
whereas O
removal O
of O
20 O
additional O
residues O
abolished O
it. O

Thus, O
CD45 B
plays O
an O
active O
role O
in O
the O
physiology O
of O
T O
cells O
and O
in O
the O
replication O
of O
HIV-1. B

One O
gene O
encodes O
a O
protein, O
RFX5, B
that O
is O
a O
member O

DNA I

proteins. I

LR1 B
contains O
two O
polypeptides, B
of O
106 B

45 B
kDa, I
and O
here O
we O
report O
that O
the O
106-kDa B
component I

LR1 O
is O
nucleolin. B

To O
date, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
receptors O
for O
IL-12 B
have O
been O
found O
only O
on O
PBMC O
following O
activation O
with O
PHA B
or O
IL-2. B

We O
identified O
an O
86-nucleotide O
fragment O
that O
is O
90% O
identical O
to O
the O
recently O
characterized O
murine O
IL-2-responsive B
element O
(mIL-2rE). O

NF-AT B
is O
thought O
to O
consist O
of O
two O
components: O
a O
ubiquitous, B
inducible I
nuclear I
component I
that O
we O
have O
identified O
as O
Fos B
and O
Jun B
proteins, I
and O
a O
preexisting, O
T B
cell-specific I
component I
(NF-ATp) O
which B
is O
the O
target O
for O
the O
immunosuppressive O
agents O
cyclosporin O
A O
(CsA) O
and O
FK506. O

The O
repetitive O
activation O
of O
T O
cells O
(priming) O
enhances O
the O
expression O
of O
many O
cytokines, B
such O
as O
IL-4, O
but O
not O
others, O
such O
as O
IL-2. B

Treatment O
of O
the O
cells O
with O
ionomycin O
resulted O
in O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
molecular O
weight O
of O
NFATp B
and O
a O
loss O
of O
32P, O
consistent O
with O
NFATp O
dephosphorylation. O

Signals O
transduced O
through O
the O

Concomitant O
with B
this O
loss O
of O
a, O
a O
new B
Ets-1-containing I

appeared. O

Thus, O
inhibition O
of O
GSK-3beta B
is O
insufficient O
to O

We O

that O

Subsequent O

The O

We O
found O
that O
the O

The O

In O
conclusion, O
our O

that O

a O

that O

that O

An O

long O

NF-kappa B

a O

a O
variety O

BACKGROUND: O
IL-5 B
controls O
development O
of O
eosinophilia O
and O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O

However, O
sequence O
specificity O
of O
NF-AT B
was O
more O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
NF(P), B
and O
only O
a O
small O

was O
detected O
in O

A O

This O

and O
appears O
to O
bind O
specific O
members O
of O
the O
NF-kappa B

These O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O

of O
the O
HIV O
promoter O
are O
essential O
for O
its O
transactivation O
during O
HHV-6(GS) B

These O
findings O
show O
that O
the O
nuclear O
accumulation O
of O
NFAT4 B
promoted O
by O
calcineurin B
is O
opposed O
by O
the O

Taken O
together, O
these O

HIV-1 B

As O

here, O
structure-function O

the O

In O
most O

is O
a O

of O
two O

which O
are O
encoded O
by O
two O

These O

may O
exert O
negative O

human O

Together, O
these O

indicate O
that O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O

suggest O
a O

The O

In O

While O

Furthermore, O
the O

because O
IL-10 B
also O
inhibited O

These O

These O

On O

In O

We O

CONCLUSIONS: O

Mechanisms O

were O
then O
evaluated O
in O
IL-6-stimulated O

These O
data O
indicate O
that O
IL-11 B
is O
a O
regulatory B
cytokine B
in O
the O

and O
that, O
like O
other O
members O
of O
this O

its O

properties O
appear O
to O

linked O
to O
its O

Indeed, O

Whereas O

the O

NF-kappa B
B, I
PMA-induced O
activation O

AP-1 B
was O
significantly O
suppressed. O

Gel O

demonstrate O
that O
NF-kappa B

nuclear O

is O
stimulated O
primarily O
by O
IL-1 B
rather O
than O
by O
antigen B

We O
evaluated O
two O
cytokine O
systems, O
IL-2 B
and O
IFNgamma, B
and O
demonstrate O
that O
Nmi B
augments O
STAT-mediated B
transcription O
in O

to O
these O
cytokines. B

ZEBRA B
is O
a O

which O
binds O
as O
a O

to O
7-bp O

Large O

alpha,25-(OH)2D3 O
thus O
impair O
the O

but O
increase O
the O

Proteins O

In O

in O
about O
30% O

Interestingly, O
treatment O
of O
purified O
HIV-TF1 B
by O

greatly O
reduced O
its O
DNA-binding O
activity, O
suggesting O
that O
phosphorylation O
of O

was O
essential O
for O

In O
supershift O
experiments O
using O

we O
showed O
that, O
in O

of O

patients O
who O
displayed O
undetectable O
NF-kappa B

p65 B

were O
not O
formed. O

Thus, O
coupling O
of O
TCR-regulated B
PTKs B
to O
downstream O
signaling O
pathways O
requires O
SLP-76. B

Furthermore, O
expression O

selectively O
stimulates O
the O

of O
a O

Incidence O

We O
interpret O
this O

a O

a O
low O

of O
the O

in O
which O

In O
conclusion, O
three O
different O
cell-specific O
pathways O
lead O
to O
NF-kappaB B
activation O
by O
IL-1beta: B
a O
pathway O
dependent O
on O

by O
5-LOX B
in O

an O

in O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
a O
pathway O
requiring O
ROI O

NADPH B

We O
investigated O

the O
IL-2Ralpha B

However, O
immediately O
after O
TcR/CD3 B
cross-linking O
(after O
approximately O
1 O
h; O
immediate) O
binding O
of O
p50.p65 B

was O
observed. O

These O
studies O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
LTR O
mutations O
assist O
SIVsmmPBj14 B
in O
responding O
efficiently O
to O
cellular O

and O
allow O
it O
to O
replicate O

high O

during O
the O
acute O
phase O
of O

infection. O

Among O
upstream B
signaling I
molecules I
of O
ERK, B
Shc B
was O
constitutively O
associated O
with O
Grb2 O
and O
was O
not O
tyrosine-phosphorylated B
by O
GM-CSF B
and O
FMLP, B
and O
Sos1 B

c-Raf-1 B
were O
not O
phosphorylated O
by O
GM-CSF, O
IL-3, O
TNF, O

FMLP O
in O

whereas O
all O
these O

utilized O

GM-CSF O

Based O
on O
peptide O
matches O
covering O
more O
than O
10% O
of O
the O
TBP7 B
sequence, I
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
migration O
of O
S6 B
on O
SDS-PAGE O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
estimated O
molecular O
mass O
for O
TBP7, O
we O
conclude O
that O
subunit B
6 I
of O
the O
26S B
protease I
is O
TBP7. O

We O
now O
demonstrate O
that O
a O
forced O
exogenous O
expression O
of O
the O
four O
different O
isoforms O
of O
WT1 O
in O
K562 O
does O
not O
affect O
the O

as O
judged O
by O

of O
hemoglobin B

or O
the O

of O

12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate O
(TPA). O

The O

consisted O
of O
p50/p50 B

p50/p65 O
heterodimers. O

JNK B
is O
involved O
in O
signal O
integration O
during O
costimulation O
of O

The O

delayed O
terminal O

into O
erythrocytes, O
which O
was O

by O

hemoglobin B

and O
the O

characteristic O
for O

PU.1 B
is O
expressed O
at O

As O
documented O
in O
the O
accompanying O
paper O
(Klug O
et O

an O

also O
suppresses O
the O
activity O
of O
NF-kappa B
B/rel I
and O
expression O
controlled O
by O
the O

Therefore, O
we O
suggest O
that O
SHP1 B
is O
not O
actively O
recruited O
to O
inhibit O
TCR B

induced O
by O
ligation O
of O
this O

Addition O
of O
GM-CSF B
to O
this O
basic O
cocktail O
consistently O
increased O
the O
clonogenic O

of O
single O
CD34+Thy-1+ O

and O
this O
effect O
was O
further O
enhanced O
(up O

by O
the O

Here O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
NF-AT B
is O
formed O
when O
a O

from O

a O
