    You are a highly skilled medical assistant tasked with rewriting patient descriptions into factual, descriptive narratives. Each entity provided must be described in its own meaningful sentence. The sentences should strictly describe the patient and avoid making inferences, assumptions, or suggestions.

    Patient Description:

    Entities:
    {json.dumps(entities)}

    Guidelines for writing the sentences:
    - Each sentence must describe one entity factually, based on the information provided in the description or the entities list.
    - Avoid making inferences, or suggesting potential outcomes, or suggesting improvements (e.g., no phrases like 'critical for improving' or 'should focus on').
    - Maintain a formal, clinical tone suitable for medical documentation.
    - Ensure statements look as they are written by a medical professional in an official medical record.
    - Ensure that the narrative remains coherent and logical when all sentences are read together. As if they are part of a single patient summary.
    - Ensure to adhere to the description when describing the patient without adding any new information not found in the description.
