Within\nthese limitations, bilateral, relatively diffuse \nperibronchovascular, nodular\nground-glass opacities, right greater than left, are suggestive \nof underlying\ninfectious or inflammatory process.\n2. Large rectosigmoid stool ball is similar in size compared to \nprior with\nrectal and sigmoid wall thickening consistent with stercoral \nproctitis. \nRecommend disimpaction.\n3. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis. Calcification of \nthe periphery\nof the gallbladder compatible with porcelain gallbladder, as \nseen previously.\n\n___ Cardiovascular Transthoracic Echo Report \nIMPRESSION: No 2D echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. \nMild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity \nsize and regional/global biventricular systolic function. \nThickened\nmitral valve with mildly elevated transvalvular gradient. Mild \nmitral and tricuspid regurgitation. mild pulmonary hypertension.\n***Transesophageal Echo done on ___, per fellow no \nevidence of vegetations, full report not finalized in our \nmedical record at time of discharge. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ year old female nursing home resident with guardian \nwith past medical history of atrial fibrillation, prior stroke \nwith residual L hemiparesis, CKD stage 3, mitral valve prolapse \nstatus post repair, schizoaffective disorder, seizure disorder, \nadmitted ___ with sepsis secondary to stercoral colitis \nand strep bovis bacteremia, treated with antibiotics with \nimprovement, TEE without signs of endocarditis, able to be \ndischarged to nursing home\n\n# Sepsis, Strep Bovis secondary to acute blood stream infection \n# Stercoral colitis \nPatient presented with fever, leukocytosis, without clear source \nof infection.  Patient initially admitted to ICU on empiric \nbroad spectrum antibiotics, where admission blood cultures \nreturned positive for strep bovis.  CT imaging showed large \nstool ball in the sigmoid colon and rectum. She was felt to \nlikely have translocation of gut bacteria in setting of this \nstercoral colitis.  Antibiotics were narrowed based on \nsensitivities and patient was treated with aggressive bowel \nregimen with resolution of constipation symptoms and abdominal \ndistension.  TTE and TEE did not demonstrate signs of \nendocarditis. A midline was placed and her last day of \nceftriaxone will be ___ for a full 14 day course of \nceftriaxone. Discharged with a more aggressive bowel regimen to \navoid future obstipation. \n\n# Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy \nPatient was lethargic on presentation in setting of sepsis.  \nInitial medical workup was unremarkable, except for above sepsis \nand infection.  Her mental status resolved to her baseline with \nthe above and she remained stable. \n\n#HYPERNATRMEMIA: \nIn setting of her acute infection,  patients sodium peaked at \n154, thought to be secondary to increased insensible losses.  \nIncreased patient free water flushes to compensate.  Sodium was \nsubsequently stable.  Final free water flush regimen was 300 cc \nq4h.  Would recheck sodium to ensure stability.  \n\n# ___ \n# CKD 3 \nPatient presented with elevated Cr to 2.2 on presentation. Her \nbaseline is 1.2.  Thought to be dehydration and sepsis, both of \nwhich were treated as above. Also found to have urinary \nretention, treated as below.  Cr resolved to baseline prior to \ndischarge. \n\n# Urinary retention \nFound to be retaining 1.3L urine on presentation.  Felt to be \nfrom her encephalopathy and constipation.  Initially had foley \nplaced.  Passed subsequent trial of void and retention did not \nrecur.  \n\n# Chronic Afib c/b CVA\nContinued apixaban, metoprolol\n\n# Schizoaffective disorder\nGiven initial sedation, home Seroquel and clonazepam were held.  \nGiven stability of mental status at baseline, did not restart \nSeroquel or clonazepam--would consider restarting at follow-up. \n\n#Porcelain Gallbladder\nIncidentally seen on imaging, stable from prior.  Would consider \noutpatient surgical referral\n\n#Seizure disorder \nContinued valproic acid\n\n#GERD \n- continued famotidine\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- Discharged to nursing home\n- Consider repeat Na check\n- Consider re-starting clonazepam and quetiapine as needed, but \nthe patient was not requiring these medications at discharge\n- Follow up porcelain gallbladder, discussing with guardian \n___ how aggressively she would want to follow this \n- Spoke to ___ prior to discharge and she would like for the \npatient to remain NPO with tube feeds to reduce risk of \naspiration. Also spoke with her re: colonoscopy and she does not \nwant to pursue this given that treatment of cancer is not within \nthe patient's goals of care\n- Last day of ceftriaxone will be ___. Please pull midline \nafter that. \n- Discharged on modified free water flush regimen: 300 cc q4h\n\n> 30 minutes spent on discharge\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1. Apixaban 5 mg PO BID \n2. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \n3. Atorvastatin 40 mg PO QPM \n4. ClonazePAM 1 mg PO BID \n5. Famotidine 20 mg PO DAILY \n6. Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg PO TID \n7.
