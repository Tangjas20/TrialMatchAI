There was concern for vasculitis\nvs. shingles, and she was treated for shingles (acyclovir -->\nvalacyclovir) without complete improvement. She was then found \nto\nhave ___ + and RF +, so she was started on prednisone (___)\nfor presumed vasculitis. Her symptoms did not improve on\nprednisone and instead progressed over the last two days. This\nhas been associated with purpling of the left great and second\ntoe. She was sent to ___ where she\nreportedly had a CTA of the lower extremity that showed\n\"Atherosclerotic plaque with bilateral mod ileo-femoral stenosis\nand severe stenosis in mid left SFA. No occlusion.\"\n\nIn the ED, patient was afebrile and normotensive. Toes were \nnoted\nto be mottled though pulses were dopplerable. Labs were notable\nfor mild thrombocytopenia (117) and transaminitis (AST 129/ALT\n134) with normal Tbili (0.2). Chem7 was within normal limits. \nCXR\nwas suggestive of chronic pulmonary disease (hyperexpansion,\nflattening of the hemidiaphragms, prominence of interstitial\nmarkings) but was without focal consolidation. \n\nVascular surgery was consulted and recommended heparin gtt, pain\ncontrol, CTA torso to evaluate for aneurysmal disease or\ndissection, full LFTs/hepatology consult given concern for\ncirrhosis ni the setting of untreated HCV and alcohol use, and\nTTE to evaluate cardiac function prior to surgery.\n\nCTA torso was obtained and showed no evidence of aortic\ndissection, moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease of the\nthoracic and abdominal aorta, and GGO of the LUL concerning for\ninfection/inflammation.\n\nPain in the ED was managed with IV morphine, IV hydromorphone, \nPO\ngabapentin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. She also received PO\nbuspirone, PO furosemide 40mg, duoneb, and folic acid. She was\nthen admitted to medicine for further management.\n\nUpon arrival to the floor, patient confirms the above history.\nShe complains of worsening intermittent pain in the left foot\nover the last two days associated with discoloration that she\nfeels is spreading. She denies any other symptoms.\n\n \nPast Medical History:\n- CAD s/p PCI\n- CVA\n- COPD\n- Cirrhosis complicated by ascites\n- Tobacco use\n- Alcohol use disorder with history of withdrawal\n- Depression\n- Chronic low back and hip pain\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nPatient did not know her biological mother.

CT here with evidence of \nmoderate/severe atherosclerotic disease in aorta that suggests \nPAD most likely leading to her ischemia. There was also concern \nfor cryoglobulinemia with history of untreated hepatitis C but \npatient was treated with prednisone 60mg as an outpatient with \nno symptomatic improvement. Rheumatology was consulted and \nrheumatologic workup (complement, inflammatory markers, etc.) \nwere not consistent with vasculitic cause of disease. Vascular \nmedicine was also consulted and recommended starting ASA, \nstatin. Vascular surgery consulted and felt presentation was \nmost consistent with atheroembolic disease and patient was \ntherefore started on a heparin gtt. ABIs showed > 50% stenosis \nof the mid superficial femoral artery and total occlusion of the \nposterior tibial artery. Patient went for angiogram on \n___. An embolism was found in the L toe.

She was started on a 30-day course of \nPlavix (end: ___, during which aspirin should be held, and \nsystemic anticoagulation (needed for 3 months) with apixaban \ngiven toe embolism (end: ___. After 30 days, she should switch \nback to aspirin. \n\n# Sepsis secondary to multifocal pneumonia\nPatient developed acute leukocytosis, hypotension, fever, and \ntachycardia and was found to have multifocal pneumonia on CT. \nShe was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for total of 7 day \ncourse. There was concern for aspiration given the distribution \nof the pneumonia, however speech and swallow eval did not find \nevidence of aspiration.\n\n# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure\n# COPD\nPatient developed new O2 requirement in the setting of \nmultifocal pneumonia likely triggering COPD exacerbation. \nTreated pneumonia as above. Patient received 2 days of stress \ndose steroids and was subsequently transitioned to prednisone \n40mg daily. Continued duonebs q6h and albuterol nebs q2h PRN. At \ntime of discharge she was discharged on prednisone 30mg with \nplan for taper. Her O2 need resolved, and she was discharged on \nroom air. \n\n# Transaminitis\n# Cirrhosis ___ Score A)\nPresents with uptrending LFTs recently with previous records \nshowing AST/ALT in the\n___. History of untreated HCV and alcohol use disorder \n(planned to see GI in ___ for HCV treatment). Presents with \ntransaminases elevated to 100s with normal Tbili. Differential \nincludes medication effect (fluconazole) vs. viral hepatitis.\nPatient denies alcohol use for 6 months. Of note, patient \nrecently started on 14 day course of fluconazole for \nasymptomatic ___ on throat culture. HCV VL showing active \nhepatitis C. LFTs downtrended with cessation of fluconazole. \nContinued home furosemide 40mg daily for volume management. \nPatient did not have evidence of ascites on abdominal \nultrasound. Patient had recent EGD which was negative for \nvarices. For encephalopathy, she was continued on lactulose. \nHome folic acid and multivitamin were continued. Patient should \nreceive outpatient treatment for HCV and HAV and HBV vaccines. \n\n# Thrombocytopenia\nMildly thrombocytopenic to 141 on presentation, but improving. \nPer outpatient records, was previously 200-300 but has been \ndowntrending since ___. Likely secondary to underlying \nliver disease.\n\n# 7mm \"Ground glass nodule\" in LUL\nWill place as transitional issue when patient leaves. CT \nfollow-up in 6 to 12 months is recommended to confirm \npersistence. If persistent, CT follow-up every ___ years until ___ \nyears after initial detection are recommended.\n\n# Code Status\nPatient presented with MOLST stating she was DNR/DNI. After \ndiscussion with HCP present, patient states that she would like \nto be full code as long as it was a limited trial and she could \nstill be interactive. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Anemia\nOngoing anemia evaluation as outpatient. Denies melena, though \nendorses intermittent hematochezia (since resolved). Received IV \niron as outpatient recently with plan to repeat labs in a few \nweeks. Hgb appears to be well above recent baseline (___).\n\n# Throat culture positive for ___ culture obtained as outpatient work up positive for \n___. No obvious signs of esophagitis on interview or exam. \nAttributed to ICS and recent systemic steroids. Received 14 day \ncourse of fluconazole.\n\n# Depression\nContinued amitriptyline 50mg daily, buspirone 7.5mg BID, \ntrazodone 150mg daily\n\n# GERD\nContinued pantoprazole\n\n#CODE: Full (see above)\n#CONTACT: ___.
