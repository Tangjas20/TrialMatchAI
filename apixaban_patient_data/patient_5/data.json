No vegetation seen on the ___ nor mitral \nvalve.\nCompared with the prior TTE ___ , tricuspid regurgitation \nis increased. The right ventricle is hypokinetic. There is \nvolume overload on the left ventricle. The tricuspid valve mass \nis similar. Aortic valve gradients slightly higher but leaflets \nmove normally. Permanent RV lead now present.\n\n___ ___\n  \nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower \nextremity veins. \n\n___ Foot Xray:\nThere is some irregularity and spurring along the lateral base \nof the first \nproximal phalanx of the great toe.  This may represent \ndegenerative changes or \nsequela of old injury.  No discrete fracture line is seen; \nhowever, please \ncorrelate with pain at this location. \n  \nThere is normal osseous mineralization.  There is some spurring \nabout the \nposterior calcaneus near the Achilles tendon attachment.  There \nare no \nerosions. \n\n___: Renal U/S\n1. Echogenic appearance of the kidneys likely reflects chronic \nmedical renal \ndisease. \n2. Trabeculated bladder may reflect chronic outlet obstruction. \n\n___ MRI cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine:\n \n1. Severe spinal canal narrowing with crowding and possibly \ncompression of the cauda equina at L2-3, mildly progressed since \n___, largely in part due to an inferiorly extruded 8 \nmm L2-3 disc fragment.  Correlate clinically with any clinical \nsigns of cauda equina syndrome. \n2. No evidence of discitis-osteomyelitis in the cervical, \nthoracic, or lumbar spine. \n3. Multifocal short-segment T2/STIR hyperintense cord signal \nabnormalities in the cervical spine are similar appearance to \nprior study from ___ however poorly visualized due to \ntechnical limitations of the study as above; within these \nconfines, these appear unchanged and late to chronic \nmyelomalacia. \n4. Multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes.  Spinal canal \nnarrowing is worst (moderate to severe) at C6-7. \n5. Expected cervical spine postoperative changes.  Expected \nlumbar spine \npostoperative changes.  Mild residual edema, likely \npostoperative, and/or \nmuscle strain in the lower lumbar spine erector spinae.  No \nfocal fluid \ncollection. \n6. Multilevel high-grade degenerative lumbar spine neural \nforaminal narrowing. \n7. No acute findings in the thoracic spine. Mild thoracic spine \ndegenerative \nchange. \n8. Possible small left layering pleural effusion, poorly \nvisualized.  Other \nincidental findings, as above. \n  \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with any symptoms or physical \nexamination \nsigns of cauda equina syndrome is recommended, as above. \n\nTEE ___:\nThere is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of \nthe left atrium/left atrial appendage. The\nleft atrial appendage ejection velocity is normal. No \nspontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the \nright atrium/right atrial appendage. No thrombus/vegetation is \nseen on the catheter/wire. The interatrial septum is dynamic, \nbut not frankly aneurysmal. There is no evidence for an atrial \nseptal defect by 2D/color Doppler. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal. There are no aortic arch atheroma \nwith simple atheroma in the descending aorta to 45 cm from the \nincisors. A ___ 3 aortic valve bioprosthesis is present. The \nprosthesis is well seated with normal leaflet motion. No masses \nor vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.

No abscess is seen. \nThere is moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve \nleaflets appear structurally normal. A LARGE (1.1 cm long) \nmobile echodensity is seen on the right atrial side of the \ntricuspid valve most c/w a VEGETATION. No abscess is seen. There \nis moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to \nacoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may \nbe UNDERestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: There is a large 1.1 cm mobile echodensity on the \nright atrial side of the tricuspid valve most consistent with a \nvegetation. No abscess seen.Moderate to severe tricuspid \nregurgitation. Well-seated ___ 3 ___ with normal leaflet \nmotion and no masses or vegetation\nor regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation.\n\nCT Chest ___:\n1. Small Left pleural effusion and trace of right pleural \neffusion. \n2.

Repeat blood cultures have all been negative for \nrecurrent bacteremia given recent admission for strep \nbacteremia. TEE showed a stable TV mass consistent with \npacemaker lead extraction. MRI of the whole spine was negative \nfor osteomyelitis. Given no evidence of recurrent infection, all \nantibiotics were stopped. Fevers did not return and the patient \nwas discharged to rehab given this was a likely viral infection. \n\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n#Fever\n#H/o strep bacteremia \nThe patient had a recent admission from ___ for \npacemaker extraction in the setting of strep sanguinis \nbacteremia. The pacemaker was removed with no complication and \nlast positive culture was on ___. Given recent dental \nprocedure, dentistry evaluated the patient, but did not think \nthis was the cause of his bacteremia. TEE at the time showed a \nTV mass on ___, but this is likely due to pacemaker extraction. \nPPM was reimplanted on ___ and discharged on IV ceftriaxone \n2g daily. The patient represented with AMS concerning for \nrecurrent bacteremia, but blood cultures were all negative. ID \nwas consulted and recommend repeat TEE which showed stable TV \nmass consistent with PPM extraction per EP. MRI spine showed no \nevidence of osteomyelitis. Discussion was had regarding need for \ncardiac CT to evaluate for abscess but this was deferred given \ncontrast load. PET-CT was considered to evaluate for ___ \ninfection but given defervescence of fevers this was deferred. \nCRP remained elevated, but given clinical improvement no \nadditional imaging was done.  Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were \ndiscontinued early on ___ prior to full 6 week course planned \nfor presumed endocarditis which was ___ and patient's fevers \ndid not recur (per infectious disease). The leading thought \nremains fevers were from a viral illness. \n\n___ on CKD\nHis Cr was stably elevated during last hospitalization \n(2.5-3.1), which may represent new baseline, and was 3.2 on \nadmission. He was given fluid resuscitation early in the \nadmission, developed crackles, elevated right-sided pressures \nnoted on TTE, therefore a component of cardiorenal was \nconsidered. He was diuresed and developed a worsening ___ \nconsistent with ATN. His diuretic was held and ATN improved. Cr \nstabilized at 2.5 and Torsemide was restarted. \n\n#Chronic HFpEF\nEF 65%. His discharge weight from ___ was 92.6 kg (204.14 lb). \nAdmission weight 93.5 kg (206.13 lb). He received fluids early \nin the admission for presumed sepsis, became overloaded and was \nhemodynamically stable so was diuresed. Metoprolol was decreased \ngiven borderline blood pressure. Cr on discharge 2.5. Weight on \ndischarge 100.8kg and 222.22lbs  but this was a bed weight. \n\n#Macrocytic anemia:\n#Thrombocytopenia: Hgb 8.6 at last discharge, 8.3 on admission. \nLikely anemia of inflammation iso infection vs chronic back pain \nand CKD. Differential for macrocytic anemia may also include MDS \ngiven some degree of thrombocytopenia and increased MCV. Less \nlikely hemolysis with normal AST and inappropriately low retics. \nThis was stable on discharge. \n\n#Altered mental status\n#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\nPresented with new onset inattention, disorientation. Likely due \nto systemic infection, renal failure, increased accumulation of \ngabapentin and Ativan with reduced renal function, perhaps \ncephalosporin neurotoxicity (though ceftriaxone not a big \noffender). NCHCT neg, non focal neuro exam. Mental status \nimproved throughout hospital course.\n\n#Acute on chronic \"back\" pain in R posterior hip\n#History of spinal stenosis s/p surgery\nHe reported pain in his right lower back, which appeared to be \nthe pelvis with pain radiating down his right leg and subjective \nnumbness of the right foot that began a few days after having a \nfall on ___ hitting his hip and acutely worsened in the past \nweek after being hospitalized and in bed. Given fever, and c/f \nbacteremia, osteo was considered. MRI showed evidence of cord \ncompression, but in the absence of new neurologic findings, the \npatient will follow up with neurosurgery as an option for \nfurther options (this was discussed with patient's \nneurosurgeon). Physical therapy recommended rehab. \n\n#Rash:\nPatient developed an erythematous rash on his back with \nsloughing of his skin concerning for contact dermatitis from the \nsheets and moisture from sweat. This had improvement with \nantifungal powder and keeping the area open to air. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:  \n================\n#Atrial fibrillation: \nHe is AV paced, was continued on apixaban 5 BID, and metoprolol.\n\n# Hx of AV block s/p PPM\nOn last admission, PPM explanted on ___ and replaced on ___. \nDevice interrogated post re-implantation and DDD mode with 100% \npacing.\n\n# ?History of COPD\nThis diagnosis is questionable as patient and wife do not \nremember a diagnosis of COPD, no PFTs in our system, never \ntobacco use, no bronchitis type symptoms, though his wife \nreports he is on ___ different inhalers at home. Provided \nflovent and albuterol inhaler. This diagnosis should be \nclarified with his primary care physician.\n\n# History of obstructive sleep apnea: Refused CPAP in the past.\n- Discuss benefits of CPAP with patient\n\n# Psychiatric history\n# Bipolar disorder, depression\n- Continued divalproex and lamotrigine\n\n# Tremor: Could be secondary to intention tremor or a medication \ninduced tremor (from Depakote) or possibly essential tremor. \nGabapentin was initially held in the setting of renal failure. \nTremor improved when this was restarted.\n \n# BPH\n- Continued tamsulosin qhs\n\n# Anxiety:\nHeld home ativan 1mg TID PRN.\n\n# Health maintenance, hyperlipidemia\nContinued aspirin daily, rosuvastatin (dosed M/Th)\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=================\nDISCHARGE Cr 2.5\nDISCHARGE weight 100.8kg and 222.22lbs but this was a BED weight \n\nDISCHARGE HGB; 8.2\nDISCHARGE AST/ALT: 48 and 57 \n\n[] follow up with neurosurgery for the findings on spine MRI \n[] trend fever curve\n[] repeat CBC/CMP/LFTs in 1 week to ensure stability of Hgb and \nCr on current regimen.
