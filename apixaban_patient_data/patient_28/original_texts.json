Consider getting a repeat TTE as an \noutpatient.\n-Atrial fibrillation: He was continued on his home rate control \nand amiodarone. However, it would seem he is in persistent AF so \nplease have him follow-up with a cardiologist as an outpatient \nfor further management and consider stopping the amiodarone if \nit has been ineffective. Further, please monitor his creatinine \nas an outpatient as his d/c creatinine was 1.3.

He \nwas still in AF during this hospitalization and presumably \ntaking amiodarone at home. \n\n#Elevated creatinine:\nOutside records reveal recent b/l Cr 1.5. thus he is within his \nknown baseline CKD. \n\n#CAD s/p CABG:\n#HLD:\n-Continue aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
