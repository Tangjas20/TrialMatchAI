Radiology: RLE US: Excluding the peroneal veins which are not clearly visualized, no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins. CXR Cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions. Brief Hospital Course: w/ AF (on apix), CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HLD, h/o R knee septic arthritis (s/p cement spacer) p/w concern for repeat septicarthritis and volume overload. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Follow-up: PCP medications: Torsemide 40 mg qd, tylenol 1 g TID -Held medications: Furosemide 80 mg qd -Discharge weight: 89.72 kg -He is on lasix at home, presumably for CHF. This was switched to torsemide 40 mg qd. He had mild volume overloaded on discharge, but denied any symptoms and wanted to go home. Please follow-up his weight as an outpatient and consider increasing his diuresis further. Consider getting a repeat TTE as an outpatient. -Atrial fibrillation: He was continued on his home rate control and amiodarone. However, it would seem he is in persistent AF so please have him follow-up with a cardiologist as an outpatient for further management and consider stopping the amiodarone if it has been ineffective. Further, please monitor his creatinine as an outpatient as his d/c creatinine was 1.3. If his Cr is chronically < 1.5 he should be on full dose apixaban (5 mg BID) instead of the dose he was taking at home (apixaban 2.5 mg BID). -Knee pain: He has a history of R knee explant and antibiotic spacer, he was continued on his home pain medications. Concern that his edema could be contributing to his pain. Please continue to monitor weights as an outpatient and consider referral back to his orthopedic surgeon if he is in persistent pain. -Functional status: He was seen by in the hospital and had several sessions. He was discharged with and services. -Discharge labs: Cr 1.3, hgb 9.4, last CRP 10.7. Please recheck a chemistry at his follow-up appointment. -CONTACT: (wife) -CODE: Full (presumed) #c/f recurrent septic R prosthetic knee: History of septic arthritis and spacer years ago at NEB. R knee pain and swelling started on w/o e/o trauma. CRP 13.2 on admission and ESR 79 at OSH. CRP has trended down and patient now feeling somewhat better, thus per ortho low c/f septic joint. His knee pain may indeed be related to lower extremity generalized edema from his insufficiently diuresed CHF. He was continued on his home pain medications and Tylenol. Improved with diuresis. recommended home with and ambulation with a rolling walker. #HFpEF: History of HFpEF in notes on . Subacute heart failure w/o symptoms of DOE, PND, orthopnea. Says he has actually lost weight recently, but his legs have edema. CXR w/ mild interstitial edema. He was diuresed with lasix 100 mg IV BID and this was transitioned to torsemide 40 mg qd (switched from his home dose of lasix 80 mg qd). He did not receive a TTE here. #AF: HRs under control. On apixaban 2.5 mg BID at home, although here he only qualified for age > (Cr as an outpatient was ~1.5, but it was 1.3 while here). Given c/f fluctuating renal status I/s/o diuresis, pt was kept on the lower dose of apixiban however renal function should be monitored as an outpt and apixiban increased to 5 mg if creatinine persistently <1.5. He was still in AF during this hospitalization and presumably taking amiodarone at home. #Elevated creatinine: Outside records reveal recent b/l Cr 1.5. thus he is within his known baseline CKD. #CAD s/p CABG: #HLD: -Continue aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.
