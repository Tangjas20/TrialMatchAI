She\ncurrently has a left sided chest Pleurx in place, which is\ndrained ___.  She she denied cough, fever,\nchills, headache, recent falls.  She denied abdominal pain,\nnausea, vomiting, but endorse chronic constipation.\n\nIn the ED, initial vital signs were 97.0 80 117/78 18 92% on \nroom\nair.\nLabs notable for normal CBC, BMP within normal limits, LFTs\nwithin normal limits with a mildly elevated alk phos of 107. \nProBNP of 2790.  UA large leuk esterase, positive nitrites,\nmoderate bacteria.\nExam notable for in short sentences, elevated JVD, no pedal\nedema.  Per the ED, point-of-care ultrasound showed a small\npericardial effusion and a large left pleural effusion.\nShe received 30 mg p.o. diltiazem, IV ceftriaxone and docusate,\nand 20 mg iV furosemide.\n\nUpon arrival to the floor, the patient tells the story as\nfollows.  She reports that over the past 3 weeks, her dyspnea on\nexertion has significantly worsened.  She reports that \npreviously\nshould be able to walk about 10 steps prior to becoming short of\nbreath, however, she can only currently walk approximately 2\nsteps.
