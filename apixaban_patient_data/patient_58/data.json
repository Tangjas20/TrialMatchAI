He as 238 lbs on discharge, his normal weight is \nbetween 236-240 lbs.  He will finish a five day course of \nantibiotics, prednisone 40 mg and azithromycin.  He was also \ndischarged with albuterol MDI (given spacer and teaching done) \nas well as Spiriva MDI.  He was counseled to have PFTs done as \nan outpatient.  He was hypoxic on arrival to the ED, but this \nhad resolved on arrival to the floor, and oxygen saturation was \n95% at rest, he did have desaturations during walking, mostly \naround 88%, but occasionally as low as 86%.  He is not \ninterested in home oxygen at this time, preferring to see if his \noxygenation improves with additional treatment.  Outpatient \nproviders should also perform ambulatory saturation.  \nHe also likely has component of obesity hypoventilation causing \nhis hypoxia.  \nHe has a long standing smoking history.  \n\n# Atrial fibrillation with RVR, Tricuspid regurgitation, HTN,\nHyperlipidemia \n- Cardiologist changed Coreg 12.5mg PO BID which he had on\nprevious discharge to Toprol XL 100mg PO daily.

Anemia may be \ndue to myelosuppression due to heavy and long standing drinking \nhistory.  \n\n#Proteinuria - Urine culture sent in the ER, but for unclear\nreasons.  No need for empiric ABX for UTI.  \n\n# Tobacco use disorder - no cigarettes in the past 2 months,\ncontinue nicotine gum \n\n# Alcohol use disorder - previously drank 6 beers/day, but none\nin the past 3 days.

He endorses drinking less (fewer days of \nthe week), is consuming vodka or gin mixed with coke, up to four \ndrinks a night.  He endorses drinking due to depression.  I \nadvised f/u with his PCP for consideration of acamprosate to \nhelp curbe drinking, and discussed risk of alcoholic liver \ninjury.  On my exam he does not have a palpable liver margin or \ngynecomastia or spider angiomata, but does have some mild palmar \nerythema.  LFTs are within normal limits, albumin pending at \ntime of discharge.  \n\n# Hyperglycemia with History of impaired glycemic control: A1c\n6.6% in ___ 5.9% in ___.

Also, \nplease discuss with her your desire to stop drinking, and to \ndiscuss whether you might be a candidate for a medication to \ncall acamprosate.  \nPlease avoid alcohol.
