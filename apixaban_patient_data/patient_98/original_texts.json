She was trialed on torsemide \n160 mg and a lasix drip but did not have sufficient urine output \nand they were discontinued. She stated that in dialysis they \nusually can only remove 2L because she gets severe leg pain as \nwell as low blood pressure. To allow for more fluid removal \nduring dialysis, we increased her midodrine from 10 mg to 15 mg \nand held her metoprolol 12.5 mg before dialysis and we gave her \nflexeril 5 mg and an extra dose of oxycodone 5 mg for her leg \nand back pain. These interventions were effective and she was \nable to get ___ off during her dialysis sessions and she had a \nfew extra dialysis sessions in addition to her MWF schedule. She \ncontinued to be hyponatremic inbetween dialysis sessions and was \nplaced on a strict 1L fluid restriction, which she reports that \nshe adheres to. She also complained of increased R knee swelling \nand had evidence of effusion on exam. She was seen by orthopedic \nsurgery and aspirate of joint fluid appeared not consistent with \nseptic joint, and per conversation with rheumatology, labs and \njoint fluid also did not seem consistent with inflammatory \narthritis, therefore further workup/treatment was deferred.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n======================\n[] On CT abd/pelv there was an incidental finding of complex \nfree fluid in the abdomen tracking into the pelvis that could be \nproteinaceous vs. blood but per ___ there nothing to do if not \nacutely bleeding and there is no layering suggesting subacute \nbleed.\n[] Patient should adhere to 1 L fluid restriction or her sodium \ncould become dangerously low.\n[] Please check CBC and electrolytes at next PCP appointment to \nmake sure stable.\n[] Her home sevelamer 800 TID w/meals was held in the setting of \npersistent hypophosphatemia. Please evaluate at PCP appointment \nthe need to re-start.\n[] Consider outpatient pain medicine referral for her chronic \nback and leg pain\n[] Pt has naloxone on med list but at PCP appointment clarify if \nshe needs another prescription given she is on multiple sedating \nmedications\n[] Patient developed non-painful swelling in Right knee. Xray \nunchanged from prior and underwent arthrocentesis with \northopedics that was bland, without PMNs or crystals. Cultures \nstill pending but low suspicion for septic joint given very low \nWBC count. Orthopedics to follow up cultures.\n[] Midodrine was increased to 15mg daily prior to HD. AM \nmetoprolol dose should be held prior to HD.\n[] Patient was given flexeril to take prior to HD to help with \ncramping. She was also started on gabapentin. Additional \noxycodone 5mg was provided prior to HD session.\n[] Ranitidine was switched to famotidine in setting of drug \nrecall.\n[] Vascular surgery team saw patient for possible vascular cause \nof leg pain during HD, recommended medical optimization for \npossible peripheral artery disease. Patient on aspirin and \nstatin.\n[] Consider adding dose of gabapentin after HD if ongoing pain.\n[] On prior hospitalization there was concern raised for MDS \ngiven her chronic anemia. Consider referral to heme/onc.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n# Anasarca\n# ESRD on HD MWF\n# Acute on chronic HFrEF\n# Cirrhosis\nPatient complaining of fluid overload, found to have anasarca on \nCT abdomen/pelvis. Notably, patient was planned to start PO \ntorsemide 20mg as outpatient ___ for edema as she still makes \nsome urine. Patient has ESRD, HFrEF and cirrhosis which were all \nlikely contributing to the current fluid collection and her last \necho on ___ with EF of 30%. Likely, she is chronically \nunderdialyzed iso hypotension and leg pain and she could not \ntolerate more than 2L of fluid removal. She was trialed on \ntorsemide uptitrated to 160 mg and subsequently a Lasix drip but \ndid not have significant urinary output to remove the fluid, so \ndiuretics were discontinued. To allow for more fluid removal \nduring dialysis, midodrine was increased from 10 mg to 15 mg and \nmetoprolol held before dialysis. For leg and back pain she \nimproved with flexeril 5 mg and an extra dose of oxycodone 5 mg \nprior to HD (she also takes her home oxycontin in the morning). \nThese interventions were effective and she was able to get ___ \noff during her dialysis sessions and she had a few extra \ndialysis sessions in addition to her ___ schedule with clinical \nimprovement. She still had a significant amount of edema in her \nlegs on discharge and will need ongoing UF outpatient.\n\n# Acute on chronic lower back pain\n# Sciatica\n# Leg pain\nSignificant history of back pain, L5/S1 radiculopathy, s/p \nsurgery at ___ but pain has been ongoing. She also has \nknown moderate spinal canal narrowing at L4-5 with crowding of \nthe nerve roots. She has chronic weakness in the RLE which has \nbeen stable for a number of years. Differential at present \nincludes nephrolithiasis and UTI, but CT showed no stone and \npatient urinates very little. Compression fracture is also on \nthe differential as she has osteopenia. On CT abd/pelv she had \ncomplex free fluid in the abdomen tracking into the pelvis and \ncould be proteinaceous vs. blood but per discussion with \nradiology and ___ there was no layering suggesting subacute bleed \nand given HD stability and intrabdominal location it would not \ncause back pain, so further workup deferred. Given on apixiban \ncould have a slow, chronic abdominal bleed but per ___ nothing to \ndo if not acutely bleeding. Her back pain improved with addition \nof flexeril and home home oxycontin and oxycodone. She stated \nshe was due for refills of oxycontin and oxycodone and missed an \nappointment for refills, so discharged with short course until \nPCP ___. ___ was consulted and recommended discharge to \nrehab but patient declined despite multiple attempts at \ncounseling.\n\n# Carotid artery stenosis\n# Peripheral vascular disease\nShe has known carotid stenosis (L >70%, R 50%) and is following \nwith Dr. ___ with vascular surgery as outpatient. Given her \nknown vascular disease, there was some concern that her pain \nduring dialysis was due to PAD and ABI showed bilateral mild \ninfrapopliteal arterial insufficiency at rest. Discussed results \nwith Dr. ___ recommended inpatient consult. Vascular \nsurgery recommended optimization with medical therapy with \naspirin and statin and with instructions for her to follow-up as \nneeded for worsening pain or other symptoms. Given her medical \ncomorbidities, further evaluation of her legs with angiography \nwas deemed to be high risk at this time.\n\n#Right knee effusion\n#Arthritis\nOn ___ she had increased swelling and warmth of her right \nknee. She has Crohns disease that is complicated by inflammatory \narthritis and she has a history of right TKR in ___ that was \ncomplicated by MRSA septic arthritis s/p TKR revision in ___. \nAlthough she did not having s/s of infection given her history \nwe consulted ortho for possible joint aspiration, which was \nbenign and without any bacteria or PMNs seen on gram stain, and \nright knee x-ray was not concerning for infection or fracture. \nResults were discussed with ___ and ___ and they \nagreed that the joint aspiration was not concerning for \ninfection and Ortho ill continue to follow-up the cultures after \ndischarge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Hyponatremia\nChronic, likely secondary to liver disease and fluid overload \nfrom inadequate UF at HD. She was maintained on strict 1L fluid \nrestriction. \n\n# Atrial fibrillation\nContinued home apixaban, metoprolol was held prior to HD per \nmost recent cardiology note.\n\n# Sciatica/Back Pain\nRecent admission for back pain. Seen by spine and thought to be \n___ sciatica. Discharged home with ___ at last admission and this \nadmission. Continued home gabapentin 300 mg daily.\n\n# Pancytopenia\n# Macrocytic Anemia\nPatient with longstanding macrocytic anemia with unclear \netiology but likely multifactorial iso cirrhosis, ESRD and \nundiagnosed MDS. ___ prior admission workup for anemia \nincluding hemolysis labs were neg, TSH was normal and there were \nno clear medications causing this change. Continued EPO with HD \nand IV iron. Some notes erroneously state that she has known \nMDS, but this is not the case. Consider referral to heme/onc. \n\n# GERD\nSwitched from home ranitidine 150 QD to famotidine in the \nsetting of ranitidine recall\n\n# Alcoholic Cirrhosis (Childs A)\nPatient has known cirrhosis with last RUQUS ___ showed no focal \nmass. Per previous hepatology notes she is due for an EGD in \n___ with her next colonoscopy. Recently seen in ___ \nclinic. Has not been drinking for past several years.\n- Home lactulose 15mL TID\n\n# Chronic Hypotension\nHome midodrine was increased from 10mg to 15 mg 3x/week before \nHD.\n\n# DMII\nDuring last admission, insulin was held given low blood sugars \nand were held again this hospitalization in the setting of low \nblood sugars. Hb A1c 4.4%. She was seen by nutrition this \nadmission.\n\n# Chronic pancreatitis\nHome Zenpep non-formulary and switched to creon 12 1 cap TID \nwith meals while hospitalized.\n\n# Crohn's Colitis\nContinued sulfasalazine\n\n# Constipation\nContinued home miralax, lactulose\n\nCORE MEASURES\n===============\n#CODE: Full, presumed\n#CONTACT: ___, ___\n\nThis patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain \nmedication at the time of discharge (please see the attached \nmedication list for details).
