The chest pain is left sided and has \nbeen coming and going, most recently this morning when she woke \nup from sleep. She has also been having intermittent posterior \nneck pains. She denies shortness of breath, fevers, chills, \ncough, new leg swelling, abdominal pain, n/v/d. She lives with \nher son who has had an influenza like illness for the past two \ndays. \n \nIn the ED:\nInitial vital signs were: T 97.8 81 132/71 18 93% RA \n\nExam notable for: Irregularly irregular rhythm, rate 80.

A small left \npleural effusion\nis also likely present.\n\nTTE ___\nThe left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately \ndilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue \nDoppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling \npressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is \nmoderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The \ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but \naortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is \nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to \nmoderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the \nseverity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly \nUNDERestimated.] [In the setting of at least moderate to severe \ntricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic \npressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial \npressure.] There is a trivial pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Moderately dilated, mildly hypokinetic right \nventricle in the setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation and \nat least mild pulmonary hypertension. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nright ventricle is larger and contracts less vigorously. The \nseverity of tricuspid regurgitation has likely increased \nfurther. \n\nRUQ ULTRASOUND ___\nNo findings to explain the patient's abdominal pain.  No acute \ncholecystitis\nor cholelithiasis.\n\nCT CHEST ___. Left lower lobe and lingular atelectasis/consolidation.  \nSmall to moderate\nleft and trace right pleural effusions.\n2. Mild interlobular septal thickening involving the left lung \nmay be related\nto atelectasis or represent mild asymmetric interstitial \npulmonary edema.\n3. Cardiomegaly with enlargement of the main pulmonary trunk, \nwhich can be\nseen in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension, in the \nappropriate\nclinical setting.\n4. Compression deformities in the thoracic spine as described \nabove.\n\nCHEST XRAY ___\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there are improved \nlung volumes. \nAgain there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette \nwith pacer\nleads extending to the right atrium and right ventricle. \nRelatively mild\nvascular congestion.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent \nwith volume\nloss in left lower lobe and probable small effusion.\nCompression deformities in the thoracic spine are better \ndemonstrated on the\nCT study of ___.\n\nMICROBIOLOGY\n=========================\n\n___ 10:30 am URINE      ___. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   URINE CULTURE (Final ___: \n      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT \nWITH SKIN\n      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. \n\nDISCHARGE LABS\n=========================\n___ 07:20AM BLOOD WBC-7.7 RBC-4.36 Hgb-13.1 Hct-39.8 MCV-91 \nMCH-30.0 MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.8 RDWSD-49.9* Plt ___\n___ 07:20AM BLOOD Glucose-95 UreaN-28* Creat-1.2* Na-139 \nK-4.5 Cl-98 HCO3-25 AnGap-16\n___ 07:20AM BLOOD Calcium-9.3 Phos-3.2 Mg-2.2\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history heart failure \nwith preserved ejection fraction, coronary artery disease s/p \nRCA stent, paroxysmal afib, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM in \n___, and hypothyroidism who presented with chest pain, felt to \nbe musculoskeletal. She was found to have hypoxemic respiratory \nfailure, felt secondary to pneumonia and HFpEF exacerbation. She \nwas treated with levofloxacin and increased Lasix, with \nresolution of hypoxia. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=========================\n# Hypoxemic respiratory failure\n# Community acquired pneumonia \n# Acute on chronic HFpEF: \nPatient presented with new oxygen requirement on admission, felt \nsecondary pneumonia and acute on chronic HFpEF after patient \nreceived IV fluid in the ED. She was treated with a 7 day course \nof levofloxacin [___] and diuresis with IV Lasix followed \nby increased dose of PO Lasix. At discharge, she was euvolemic \non exam and breathing comfortably on room air. Her ambulatory \noxygen saturation ws 91-93%. She will follow up with cardiology \nand pulmonology as an outpatient with repeat chest xray to \nensure resolution of pleural effusion and consolidation.\n\n# AFib with RVR: \n# Tachy-brady syndrome: \nOn admission, pacemaker interrogation was notable for several \nepisodes of afib with RVR. She had episodes of Afib with RVR \nduring admission as well, likely secondary to pneumonia and \nvolume overload as above. She remained hemodynamically stable \nand denied any symptoms during these episodes other than \noccasional \"head heaviness\". She was unaware of most of these \nepisodes. Given prior bradycardia and hypotension with more \naggressive rate control, she was continued on home verapamil and \ndose-reduced apixaban (CHADS-VASC 3). She will follow up with \ncardiology as an outpatient. \n\n# Musculoskeletal chest pain\nPatient presented with three days of intermittent chest pain \nthat improved with Tylenol. Her chest pain was focal, \nleft-sided, and reproducible with palpation, most consistent \nwith musculoskeletal pain. EKG showed no evidence of ischemia, \nand troponin/CKMB were negative x 2. Chest pain resolved during \nadmission. Her home atorvastatin and apixaban were continued. \nShe is not on aspirin at home to decrease bleeding risk.\n\n# GERD\nPatient complained of burning pain in epigastric area with \neating, consistent with GERD. She was started on omeprazole 20mg \nand Maalox prn, with improvement in symptoms. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n============================\n# Intermittent RUQ pain:\nPatient had RUQ pain intermittently with eating. RUQ ultrasound \nwas unremarkable. She had a similar episode several weeks ago, \nwhich was felt to be sphincter of odi dysfunction. Patient may \nbenefit from HIDA scan as outpatient if pain continues. \n\n# Hypothyroidism:\nTSH 4.1. Continued home levothyroxine.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n==========================\nDISCHARGE WEIGHT: 59.2 kg (130.51 lb) \n\n[] Started on omeprazole and Maalox prn for GERD.\n[] Spironolactone was held at discharge given hyperkalemia on \nadmission. Please ___ as appropriate.\n[] Please monitor patient's weight and volume exam, and adjust \nLasix dosing as needed. \n[] Patient will follow up with cardiology in 3 weeks. \n[] Patient needs repeat chest xray and follow up with \npulmonology in 6 weeks to assess improvement in pleural effusion \nand consolidation. \n[] Patient may benefit from HIDA scan as outpatient if RUQ pain \ncontinues. \n\n#CODE: Full code (confirmed)\n#CONTACT: ___ (son) Phone: ___\n \n___ on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
