Patient presents from a facility with a few episodes of \nBRBPR, with stable hemodynamics and CBCs to date. CTA A/P \nwithout active extravasation but notable for concern for lower \nGI bleeding from diverticulosis vs AVM vs hemorroidal bleeding. \nPatient was evaluated by GI who felt that given his stable \nlabs/hemodynamics and lack of significant bleeding while \ninpatient, the therapeutic potential of a sigmoidoscopy would be \nlimited and therefore was deferred given his preferences per his \nHCP ___. His HCP/daughter did feel that the recent transition \nfrom Coumadin to Apixaban aggravated this bleed. Given deferral \nof endoscopic procedure, patient was restarted on his Apixaban \nbut at a lower dose 2.5 mg BID given concern with bleeding at \nthe higher dose (5 mg BID) and also low CHADS2VASC 3 (on it for \nhistory of atrial fibrillation). He was monitored on lower dose \nApixaban for 2 days prior to discharge and did have minor \nbleeding streaked in with stools, however his CBCs and vital \nsigns continued to remain stable. A bowel regimen to soften his \nstools was administered and efforts to reduce constipation and \nstraining should be pursued in the future. \n\n___ on CKD. Baseline Cr ~1.2, though has recently increased to \n1.5. Previously with urinary retention and poor po intake. He \ndid receive 2L IVF with Cr stabilizing at 1.3 on discharge.\n\n#UTI. UA is concerning for infection and labs demonstrate a \nleukocytosis. Patient is poor historian given baseline dementia \nand unable to describe specific symptoms, however given \nleukocytosis, ceftriaxone was started and narrowed to \nciprofloxacin given growth of pseudomonas, for a total five day \ncourse (last dose tonight).\n\n#Leukocytosis. No focal infectious etiology though patient is a \npoor historian. He did recently complete a course of abx with \ndoxycycline on ___ for aspiration PNA. CXR on this admission \nwithout concerning features, though urine culture positive as \nabove. Leukocytosis improved following initiation of Ceftriaxone \n(management as above). \n\n#Hypertension. Patient's metoprolol should be restarted on \ndischarge, initially held when there was concern for GI \nbleeding. \n\n#Atrial fibrillation. CHADS2VASC 3. He had been transitioned \nfrom warfarin to apixiban about 2 weeks ago. He was restarted on \nlower dose apixaban 2.5 mg BID in the setting of bleed as above, \ngiven low CHADS2VASC. \n\n#BPH. His home tamsulosin was continued. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=================\n[ ] Last dose of Ciprofloxacin should be taken around 2200 on \n___ for 5 day course of treatment of UTI\n[ ] Apixaban decreased to 2.5 mg BID in the setting of bleed and \nlow CHADS2VASC 3\n[ ] Continue pureed solids/nectar prethickened liquids as diet \nas outpatient given history of multiple aspiration events.

It is possible that your bleeding may have been \naggravated by the Apixaban that was recently started. As a \nresult, we lowered your dose of Apixaban and you tolerated this \nwell. You continued to have some mild streaking of blood with \nyour stools but this is likely aggravated by hemorrhoids which \ncan bleed when you're constipated and straining. Your blood \ncounts and vital signs were stable and as a result, a \ncolonoscopy was not consistent with your goals at this time. You \nwere given a bowel regimen to soften your stools and to reduce \nstraining and therefore bleeding. \n\nYour urine also showed a urinary tract infection for which you \nwere started on antibiotics and you will complete your last dose \nof antibiotics tonight.\n\nYou should take your medications as listed below and attend your \nfollow-up appointments.\n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you!\n\nYour ___ Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"
