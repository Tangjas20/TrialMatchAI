Admission to\nmedicine service for management of osteomyelitis was complicated\nby respiratory failure. The patient briefly went to the ICU \nwhere she was put on BiPAP. After discharge from ICU, she \nreceived right heart catheterization which demonstrated elevated \nfilling pressures. She was sent to the cardiology floor and \ndiuresed until symptomatic relief. Hospital course was also \ncomplicated by AF for which she was started on metoprolol and \nwarfarin. \n\nACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:\n====================\n# Non-healing wound s/p ___ and ___ partial metatarsal resection\n# Concern for ___\nTransferred from ___ for multidisciplinary planning given\nprolonged history with poor wound healing.

Improved following solumedrol, biPAP, and IV\ndiuresis. Respiratory status greatly improved after aggressive \ndiuresis and treatment for COPD exacerbation.\n\n# ___ course was complicated by newly identified AF with RVR. \nShe was started in metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily and \nwarfarin. Pharmacy did not recommend a NOAC due to body habitus. \n\n\n# Chronic pain\nLong history of narcotic use for chronic pain. Has had increased\nsomnolence with oxycodone in the past and may be contributing to\nrespiratory distress. Patient reporting breakthrough pain, but\nconcerns about somnolence. \n\n# Chronic anemia\nSuspect ___ to CKD and anemia of chronic disease. Patient was \nasymptomatic with Hgb between ___ during admission. \n\nCHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:\n======================\n\n# CKD (stage unknown)\nPer report, baseline reportedly unclear with ranging from \n0.7-2.6\nover the last year, though Cr has been at 1.5 during ___. \nPatient's creatinine was stable at 1.5 at discharge. \n\n#COPD (baseline ___ home inhaler regimen.
