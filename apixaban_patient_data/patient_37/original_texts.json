She was afebrile with normal WBC count, no cough \nand CXR without clear pneumonia or edema. She was rapidly weaned \nfrom 2L NC to room air. She was maintained on oxygen for comfort \n(100%RA when trialed off) however this was weaned after diuresis \nas below and treatment of anemia. \n\n#Moderate Protein-Calorie Malnutrition\nPatient with history of malnutrition and complicated ICU course \nin ___. On this admission, she was noted to have \nmarkedly depressed albumin with anasarca consistent with \nmalnutrition.

We \ndiscussed starting an appetite stimulant with the patient and \nher family who were interested in this option and she was \nstarted on mirtazapine which was uptitrated to 15mg qhs. She had \nsome improvement in PO intake with mirtazapine however given \ndegree of malnutrition, nutrition felt she was likely going to \nbe unable to meet her caloric needs and rebuild her nutritional \nstatus without nutritional assistance. ___ (___) was placed \nvia EGD by GI on ___. Tube feeds were started on ___ and \ncycled started on ___. Initially Ms. ___ had some vomiting \nafter starting to cycle the feeds, so the feeds were changed \nback to continuous for ___.

Plan is for tube feeds for ___ weeks pending \nnutritional status and improved PO intake (improving prior to \ndischarge). Cycled tube feeds for 12 hours daily to reach 71% of \ndaily caloric needs. \n\n#Anasarca\n#Total body pain\nMs. ___ was profoundly ___ on admission likely ___ \nhypoalbuminemia which improved with IV diuresis with albumin. \nShe will need ongoing lasix at discharge 20 mg PO daily and \nclose PCP follow up to determine her ongoing need for diuresis.\n\n# Acute on chronic macrocytic anemia: H/H at baseline initially, \ndowntrended possibly related to fluid shifts with albumin \nadministration and patient received 1u pRBC on ___. Hgb stable \nfollowing transfusion. Of note, she has had a progressive rise \nin MCV over the last few months. Will need ongoing anemia \nwork-up as outpatient. Continued home B12 and folate.  \n\n#Hypernatremia: Developed hypernatremia in setting of diuresis \nwhich resolved with free water flushes through dobhoff. \n\n#E. coli urinary tract infection\nPatient recently treated with macrobid however prior urine \nculture was contaminated.

Consider further \nweaning to 10mg qhs for sleep in ___ weeks\n[ ]Per discussion with patient's family, would benefit from \npsych follow-up or counseling as outpatient\n[ ]Plan for tube feeds for ___ weeks to increase nutrition, \nplease reassess nutritional status in 2 weeks to determine \ntiming of dobhoff removal. \n[ ]Monitoring of volume status and titration of lasix\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
