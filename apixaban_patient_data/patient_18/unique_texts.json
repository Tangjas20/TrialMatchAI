Limited assessment of the left calf veins due to lower extremity edema. CXR (): IMPRESSION: Pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities likely secondary to atelectasis, however a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. CXR PORTABLE (): FINDINGS: The tips of a right internal jugular and left subclavian central venous catheters both project over the distal SVC. There are low bilateral lung volumes. The degree of pulmonary edema has decreased however it does persist. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. IMPRESSION: Slight interval decrease extent of pulmonary edema. ECHO : IMPRESSION The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate () mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of , the findings are similar. CT Chest : -Pulmonary mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormalities associated with traction bronchiectasis, progressed comparison to , possibly represents NSIP. Findings are likely exaggerated by concomitant remnants of pulmonary edema. -No findings to suggest infection. No evidence of intrathoracic malignancy. CT AP : 1. New right inguinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 34 x 20 mm. 2. Otherwise no acute findings the abdomen or pelvis. 3. Fibrotic interstitial lung disease the lung bases appears similar to the recent prior chest CT exam. 4. Cholelithiasis. 5. Small hiatal hernia. 6. Unchanged large right inguinal hernia containing nonincarcerated small bowel and cecum. CT Head : 1. No acute, large territorial infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. 2. Encephalomalacia of the right occipital lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere is unchanged consistent with prior infarct. 3. Mucosal thickening of the left posterior ethmoid air cells and complete opacification of bilateral sphenoid sinuses. 4. Global cerebral volume loss alongside likely chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Renal ultrasound : Normal appearing kidneys with no hydronephrosis. Large right upper pole simple cyst noted incidentally.

TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED. NOTIFIED AT 19:54 ON . Brief Hospital Course: w/ a history of DLBCL, who presents with dyspnea and hypoxic respiratory failure as a transfer from OSH, course complicated by fever, shock, and status epilepticus. ACUTE ISSUES # Hypoxic respiratory failure Patient had fever at OSH and evidence of PNA on exam per records, and with increasing cough per history possibly element of PNA. Given ceftriaxone and azithro initially, but as no fevers, WBC, productive cough, or evidence of focal consolidation on CXR here, so antibiotics were initially stopped. However, she later developed fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension, concerning for sepsis, so broad spectrum antibiotics were restarted. CT torso did not show sign of infection, but given critical illness she was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics with cefepime transitioned to Zosyn given concerns that Cefepime had lead to altered mental status. # Status Epilepticus On AM, due to persistent and profound encephalopathy, EEG was obtained, showing she was status epilepticus. Neurology was consulted, and the patient was loaded with Ativan and Keppra. CT Head showed no interval change. On she continued to be status epilepticus and was loaded on Phenytoin. She was then transferred back to the MICU. Ultimately, her seizures broke, but she never regained mental status. It was felt that the underlying etiology was rapid worsening of her lymphoma that invaded her CNS. # Shock # Fever Requiring norepinephrine for hypotension initially. CVO2 75, so unlikely cardiogenic. Concerning for possible sepsis setting of leukocytosis and fevers. On transfer back to the ICU patient again had a small pressor requirement. Given her persistent fevers a CT a/p was done to assess for other infection, and none was found, but adenopathy was noted. Heme/onc consulted given concern that fevers, lymphadenopathy seen on CT a/p, and pancytopenia could be related to lymphoma. On , she continued to have hypotension, requiring fluid boluses to maintain appropriate MAP. Thus, transferred back to ICU on . The patient had stable blood pressures when back the ICU, but continued to spike fevers. These were felt to be due to her underlying likely malignancy. # Lymphoma Patient's family noted that when she had recurrence of lymphoma, she sometimes presented like this. \"Other\" cells noted on differential of WBC, which was reviewed by pathology and found to be atypical cells, likely the setting of infection. A CT a/p was done to assess for other infection, and none was found. Heme/onc consulted given concern that fevers, lymphadenopathy seen on CT a/p, and pancytopenia could be related to relapse of lymphoma. was consulted for LN biopsy. Ultimately, lymph node biopsy preliminary pathology was consistent with high grade lymphoma recurrence. As per the patient's outpatient oncologist, lymphoma had likely infiltrated her lungs, CNS, and bone marrow. She was ultimately made DNR/DNI and comfort measures only. She passed away on . #Afib Held home metoprolol and continued apixaban at first. Apixaban stopped on given need for LP to work up encephalopathy. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Patient passed away on . Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires futher investigation. 1. Apixaban 5 mg PO BID 2. Metoprolol Succinate XL 100 mg PO DAILY 3. Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY 4. Torsemide 40 mg PO DAILY 5. Valsartan 40 mg PO DAILY 6. Vitamin D Dose is Unknown PO DAILY 7. Acyclovir Dose is Unknown PO Frequency is Unknown 8.
