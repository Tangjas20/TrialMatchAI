Given ceftriaxone and azithro initially, but as no \nfevers, WBC, productive cough, or evidence of focal \nconsolidation on CXR here, so antibiotics were initially \nstopped. However, she later developed fevers, leukocytosis, and \nhypotension, concerning for sepsis, so broad spectrum \nantibiotics were restarted. CT torso did not show sign of \ninfection, but given critical illness she was continued on broad \nspectrum antibiotics with cefepime transitioned to Zosyn given \nconcerns that Cefepime had lead to altered mental status.  \n\n# Status Epilepticus\nOn ___ AM, due to persistent and profound encephalopathy, EEG \nwas obtained, showing she was ___ status epilepticus.  Neurology \nwas consulted, and the patient was loaded with Ativan and \nKeppra.  CT Head showed no interval change.  On ___ she \ncontinued to be ___ status epilepticus and was loaded on \nPhenytoin. She was then transferred back to the MICU. \nUltimately, her seizures broke, but she never regained mental \nstatus. It was felt that the underlying etiology was rapid \nworsening of her lymphoma that invaded her CNS.\n\n# Shock\n# Fever\nRequiring norepinephrine for hypotension initially. CVO2 75, so \nunlikely cardiogenic. Concerning for possible sepsis ___ setting \nof leukocytosis and fevers. On transfer back to the ICU patient \nagain had a small pressor requirement. Given her persistent \nfevers a CT a/p was done ___ to assess for other infection, and \nnone was found, but adenopathy was noted. Heme/onc consulted \ngiven concern that fevers, lymphadenopathy seen on CT a/p, and \npancytopenia could be related to lymphoma. On ___, she \ncontinued to have hypotension, requiring fluid boluses to \nmaintain appropriate MAP.  Thus, transferred back to ICU on \n___. The patient had stable blood pressures when back ___ the \nICU, but continued to spike fevers. These were felt to be due to \nher underlying likely malignancy.\n\n# Lymphoma\nPatient's family noted that when she had recurrence of lymphoma, \nshe sometimes presented like this. \"Other\" cells noted on \ndifferential of WBC, which was reviewed by pathology and found \nto be atypical cells, likely ___ the setting of infection. A CT \na/p was done ___ to assess for other infection, and none was \nfound. Heme/onc consulted given concern that fevers, \nlymphadenopathy seen on CT a/p, and pancytopenia could be \nrelated to relapse of lymphoma. ___ was consulted for LN biopsy. \nUltimately, lymph node biopsy preliminary pathology was \nconsistent with high grade lymphoma recurrence. As per the \npatient's outpatient oncologist, lymphoma had likely infiltrated \nher lungs, CNS, and bone marrow. She was ultimately made DNR/DNI \nand comfort measures only. She passed away on ___.\n\n#Afib\nHeld home metoprolol and continued apixaban at first.  Apixaban \nstopped on ___ given need for LP to work up encephalopathy.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n==================\nPatient passed away on ___.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1. Apixaban 5 mg PO BID \n2. Metoprolol Succinate XL 100 mg PO DAILY \n3. Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY \n4. Torsemide 40 mg PO DAILY \n5. Valsartan 40 mg PO DAILY \n6.
