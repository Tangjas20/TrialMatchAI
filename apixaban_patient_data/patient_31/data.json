Two weeks prior to \npresentation, patient developed groin pruritis and rash. \nPruritis improved with vagisil but the pruritis continued, \npatient noticed discharged, and patient felt it should be \nexamined by a physician. Patient in area since brother is \ncurrently inpatient on Farr11. She reports that she has had \ndecreased oral and fluid intake. She has been feeling slightly \nlightheaded. She denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, \npalpitations, dysuria, hematuria, vaginal discharge, increasing \nfrequency, back pain.\nIn the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 63 113/74 18 100% RA. Labs were \nnotable for: WBC 6.6 with PMNs 70.8. Eos 5.0. Chem7 with Cr 2.7 \n(baseline ___ as per renal note), K 5.9 HCO3 14. \nlactate 0.9. VBG 7.18 / 38 / 50. Repeat labs were notable for K \n5.6 with HCO3 14 and Cr downtrended to 2.5. She did have an \nepisode of asymptomatic bradycardia. Rectal exam was negative. \nCXR showed central pulmonary vascular engorgement. Mildly \nprominent right hilum. Renal was called and recommended medical \nmanagement without any acute indication for dialysis. EP was \nconsulted given the patient's atrial fibrillation with \nbradycardia that they attributed to hyperkalemia and acidemia. \nShe was given Vancomcyin, ceftriaxone, and insulin. Her vitals \nprior to transfer were: 98.4 60 142/49 18 99% RA.\nIn FICU, her creatinine trended downward with IVF and holding \nlisinopril. Hyperkalemia was managed with several doses of \ninsulin/D50 in addition to Bicarb. Nephrology consult \nrecommended D5/Bicarbonate as they felt she most likely \nsecondary to an RTA. Renal ultrasound negative for \nhydronephrosis (but did not use doppler). Patient had no EKG \nchanges and was kept on ceftriaxone. She requested to come to \nthe ___ to be close to her brother.\nThis morning on CC7, patient feels overall similar to \npresentation, feeling tired/fatigued, hasnÂ’t been out of bed, \nand her pruritis from right groin is improved.

Mildly \nprominent right hilum may be due to vascular engorgement but \nunderlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded. Findings could be \nfurther assessed on a nonurgent chest CT.  \n\nRenal Ultrasound: No hydronephrosis. Mild bilateral renal \ncortical thinning.  Small amount of free fluid adjacent to the \nleft kidney.\n\nEchocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left \natrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal \nechocardiography). The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ \nmmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nnormal cavity size and regional/global systolic function \n(LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal \n(>=2.5L/min/m2).

Her \nhyperkalemia, AoCKD, and acidosis resolved with IV hydration, \nbicarbonate infusions, dextrose/insulin, and laxatives including \nkayexolate (were stable >24 hours without intervention prior to \ndischarge). Her groin cellulitis (likely in setting of candidal \nintertrigo) was initially treated with vancomycin/ceftriaxone \nand narrowed to amoxicillin-clavulanate/doxycline along with \nmiconazole powder with continued improvement in signs/symptoms \nand lack of fever. She was noted to have atrial fibrillation \nwith ventricular rates ___ (no clear lightheadedness, \npresyncope, chest pain, or dyspnea); per patient she had this \nfor ___ years but per PCP notes and EKGs patient had no history \nof this from ___ onward. Patient was started on apixaban in \ndiscussion with patient, inpatient team, cardiology, and primary \nteam. ___ recommended ___ rehab given deconditioning and \nhealth situation of her brother.\n\n# Atrial Fibrillation with Slow Ventricular Response / \nAsymptomatic Bradycardia: Per patient report she has had atrial \nfibrillation for years (CHADS 3 for HTN, Age, DM but not on \nanticoagulation or rate/rhythm control) but currently noted to \nbe in persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation with slowed \nventricular response (likely worsened in the setting of \nhyperkalemia and acidemia).  However her electrical rhythm did \nnot normalize with normalization of electrolytes.  ICU consulted \nElectrophysiology Consult who felt that she she be \nanticoagulated and should followup with an outpatient \ncardiologist.  She was put on apixaban 2.5mg PO BID (due to age \nand renal function), was monitored on telemetry (AFib with HR \ngenerally 40-60s occasionally ___ or ___, and an echocardiogram \nshowed only mild structural heart disease.\n\n# Hyperkalemia / Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis / Acute on \nChronic Kidney Disease: Patient with CKD Stage III presents with \nCr 2.7 from 1.5-1.6 baseline in setting of poor PO intake as \nwell as hyperkalemia and nonunion gap metabolic acidosis.  \nNephrology was consulted for assistance.  ___ is likely a \nprerenal process given improvement with IVF (renal ultrasound \nunremarkable aside from mild cortical thickening with normal LDH \nnonsuggestive of infearction, urine electrolytes suggest a \nsodium-conserving process).  Hyperkalemia is most likely \nmultifactorial with ___ and acidemia contributing possibly with \nconcomitant renal tubular acidosis. ___ have component of \nchronic respiratory acidosis from obesity hypoventilation.  \nBradycardia most likely secondary to acidemia and elevated K but \nno evidence of other ECG changes.  Patient would most likely \nhave Type IV RTA given diabetes mellitus and hyperkalemia this \nthis is a challenging diagnosis to make in the setting of ___.  \nFrom ___, she was given several doses of insulin/D50, \nkayexolate, calcium carbonate, and 5 liters of intravenous \nbicarbonate with resolution of her hyperkalemia and metabolic \nacidosis.  On ___, her electrolytes and renal function \nnormalized and were maintained from ___ without interventions. \nLisinopril was held due to advanced age, near-normotension, and \nconcern for future hyperkalemia.\n\n# Groin Rash / Candidal Intertrigo with Secondary Bacterial \nCellulitis: Patient noted to have right groin erythema/pruritis \nfor 2 weeks prior to admission (possibly secondary to lack of \nability to do laudry at home). Topical antifungals improved the \npruritis but not the rash and patient began to have systemic \nsymptoms (poor PO intake, malaise, ___. Differential includes \ncellulitis (but improvement with topical antifungals, maybe be \nsuperimposed on intertriginous process) versus ___ \nintertrigo (no satellite lesions, fluid filled vesicles).  \nAntibiotic regimen was initialy vancomycin/ceftriaxone, stepped \ndown to ceftriaxone, and finally to \namoxicillin-clavulanate/doxycycline for total course of 7 days.  \nShe was continued on Amox-Clav and Doxycyline through ___ and \nMiconazole Powder through ___.\n\n# Acute Gout Flare: Patient complained of pain in left and right \n___ MTP joints and was noted at 11:15 on ___ to have a red \nswollen and clearly tender ___ right MTP joint.  Due to \nprecarious renal function (contraindications to NSAIDs and \ncolcichine), patient was started on prednisone 40mg PO daily x3 \ndays (given resolution of symptoms within 24 hours of treatment) \n30mg x3 days, 20mg x3 days, 10mg x3 days then discontinuation.  \n\n# Type II Diabetes Mellitus on oral medications: Chronic stable \nissue on ISS and diabetic diet with home glipizide being held as \ninpatient; due to overall stability of her diabetes her \nfingersticks were reduced to AM fasting with sliding scale \nstarting at >200 but this was reconsidered due to use of \ncorticosteroids for gout.  \n\n# Hypertension: Chronic stable issue continued on home \namlodipine but lisinopril held given ___.  Her \nsystolic blood pressures in house were maintained between \n110-150s.  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUE:\n- Started on doxycycline and amoxicillin-clavulanate through \n___ for inguinal cellulitis\n- Started on miconazole powder through ___ for candidal \nintertrigo\n- Started on apixaban for atrial fibrillation with CHADS Score 3\n- Started on prednisone 40mg for brief course for gout treatment \n(concerns about colchicine and NSAIDs, continued on insulin \nsliding scale for longer period given likely hyperglycemia); \ngiven renal function may be a candidate for permanent gout \nprophylaxis\n- Discontinued lisinopril given ___ and hyperkalemia\n- Creatinine 1.5 on discharge with normal electrolytes\n- Code Status; Full Code\n- Contact: Patient, Brother\n- ___ Rehab\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
