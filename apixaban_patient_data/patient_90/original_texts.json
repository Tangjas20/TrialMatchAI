Consider repeat echo vs. stress test vs. cath \nas outpatient. \n- Consider discontinuation of diltiazem if EF does not further \nimprove\n- Continue to titrate BP meds to goal SBP <160, though strict \ngoal is no longer essential from a neurosurgery standpoint. \n[ ]Quetiapine started ___ setting of hyperactive delirium, please \ndiscontinue ___ ___ weeks pending mental status. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
