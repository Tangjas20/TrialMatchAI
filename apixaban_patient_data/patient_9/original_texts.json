The pancreas and \nspleen,\nadrenal glands and IVC are normal. Abdominal aorta and branches \nare\ncalcified and tortuous without aneurysmal dilatation.\nA large right retroperitoneal hematoma displaces the right \nkidney\nanteriorly. An ill-defined subcentimeter focus of contrast at \nthe\nright L3 level could reflect a source of active hemorrhage, \nprobably\nfrom a lumbar artery. No renal calculus, hydronephrosis or mass.\nNo bowel dilatation or inflammatory focus. The appendix is \nnormal. No\nabnormal stool burden.\nAssessment of the pelvis is limited by streak artifact from \nbilateral\nhip prostheses. The urinary bladder and reproductive organs are \nnot\nwell assessed for this reason.\nNo free fluid or drainable collection.\nAdvanced pan lumbar disc and facet degenerative changes. No \nacute\nosseous abnormality.\nCONCLUSION: Large right retroperitoneal hematoma, new from \n___\nCT of the lumbar spine. An ill-defined sub-centimeter focus of\ncontrast at the level of L3 may be the source of active \nhemorrhage,\npossibly from a lumbar artery.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ F PMHx atrial fibrillation on apixaban, HTN, HLD, \nhypothyroid, and chronic lower back pain from RA, who presented \nwith back pain, RLQ abdominal pain, and syncope, found to have \nlarge retroperitoneal hematoma. This occurred in the setting of \nan anticoagulation bridge (using lovenox) to an epidural spinal \ncatheter procedure. After presentation, she was given protamine \nsulfate and blood transfusions with improvement. After her blood \ncounts stabilized and she showed no further signs of bleeding, \nshe was trialed on an IV heparin drip, and then transitioned \nback to apixiban prior to discharge. \n\nACUTE ISSUES \n=============== \n#. Retroperitoneal bleed\nPresented to ___ initially with back pain, RLQ abdominal \npain, and syncope, found to have acute blood loss anemia (Hgb 13 \nto 10) and large RP bleed. Etiology unclear, possibly due \nLovenox bridge for upcoming epidural catheter placement, as \ndosing administered for 80kg weight rather than her weight of \n70kg. CTA showed active contrast at L3 level, concerning for \nactive lumbar artery bleed, but no bone changes were seen on CT \nto suggest predisposing silent fracture of lumbar facet. At OSH \nshe received 1 u pRBCs and protamine sulfate for heparin \nreversal and was transferred to ___. She received an \nadditional 2U PRBC at ___. ___ was consulted for possible \nembolization but patient remained hemodynamically stable and \nhemoglobin stabilized without intervention. On day 4 after \npresentation she was restarted on heparin due to her high risk \nof embolism with history of A Fib, TIA, and HTN (ChadsVasc 6). \nShe remained hemodynamically stable after 24 hours on IV heparin \ndrip. With close monitoring, she was transitioned to home dose \nof apixaban and ultimately maintained hemodynamic stability and \nstable Hgb levels. She was discharged with Hgb of 10. Her \noutpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ was contacted. \n\n# Acute on chronic back and R leg/groin pain\nPatient presented with persistent back/R leg/groin pain with a \nsharp intermittent stabbing quality with associated sensation of \nmuscle spasms and restlessness. It appeared similar in quality \nto her chronic back and hip pain from rheumatoid arthritis, but \nacutely worsened, potentially due to iron deficiency from blood \nloss and from mild nerve compression by mass effect from her \nlarge hematoma. Her pain was treated by Tylenol, low dose \ntramadol, and baclofen. She had been planning to have an \nepidural catheter placement to treat this chronic pain, but \nmissed the procedure because of this admission. \n\n# Thrombocytopenia\nPlatelet count was low during this admission, reaching low of \n122, now improved and stable above 150. Etiology is likely \ndilutional from fluids and RBC transfusions, and patient may \nhave underlying thrombocytopenia from methotrexate. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES \n=============== \n# Atrial fibrillation\nPatient has CHADS-VASC of 6 and prior TIA and takes apixaban at \nhome. It was held temporarily during admission until bleeding \nwas stopped, and then restarted on ___. Her home digoxin was \ncontinued. Metoprolol was held and not restarted during \nadmission because her heart rates remained stable, and her blood \npressures were borderline low\n\n# History of a TIA\nHistory of a TIA now on apixaban. It is thought that the \npre-procedure lovenox bridge she was started on could have \ncontributed to the above bleed, and it is important that if she \nis to undergo an epidural catheter placement or any future \nprocedures, that anticoagulation be selected and dosed \ncarefully.\n\n# Hypertension\nPatient's home amlodipine was held in the setting of bleeding \nand soft blood pressures. \n\n# Hyperlipidemia \nContinued home statin.\n\n# Depression\nContinued home citalopram.\n\n#Hypothyroidism\nContinue home levothyroxine.\n\n#Rheumatoid Arthritis\nHeld one dose of patient's weekly methotrexate due to her acute \nblood loss anemia. She should take her next dose as scheduled.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[] Repeat CBC on ___, discharge Hb ~10\n[] Patient will require significant ongoing discussions with her \ncardiologist and surgeons regarding how best to approach her \nanticoagulation and bridging therapy given her recent \nsignificant bleeding episode. She may be a candidate for \nnon-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent thrombosis secondary \nto her atrial fibrillation. \n[] Resume home metoprolol and amlodipine as tolerated\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
