Nonvisualization of \nthe spleen\ndue to patient being intubated.\n3. Gallbladder wall edema related to underlying severe liver \ndisease.  No\ncholecystitis.\n4. Small right pleural effusion\n\nTTE ___\nThe left atrium is normal ___ size. A septal occluder device is \nseen across the interatrial septum. Color-flow imaging of the \ninteratrial septum raises the suspicion of a residual left to \nright shunt, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of \nthis study. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size \nare normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low \nnormal (LVEF 50-55%) secondary to very mild hypokinesis of the \nbasal-mid inferior and mid inferolateral walls. Tissue Doppler \nimaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure \n(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately \ndilated with mild-moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good \nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. \nThe estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction \nconsistent with CAD. Dilated right ventricle with mild-moderate \nglobal hypokinesis and mild-moderate functional tricuspid \nregurgitation. Well seated septal occluder device with \nsuggestion of left to right shunt by color Doppler\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, a \nleft to right shunt across the septal occluder device is \nsuggested, but not as clearly seen as on prior images. \n\nCT Head ___.  Possible diffuse loss of gray-white differentiation.  This \nraises a\nconcern of swelling potentially associated with hepatic and \nrenal failure.\n2. No evidence hemorrhage or mass effect.\n2.  Moderate to severe paranasal sinus disease, likely a \ncomponent of active sinusitis.\n3.  Calcifications may suggest sequelae of prior infection.\n\nCT Head ___. No evidence of hemorrhage, acute vascular territorial \ninfarction, edema, or mass effect. \n2. Essentially unchanged appearance of poor gray-white matter \ndifferentiation, particularly ___ the frontal lobes. \n3. Paranasal sinus inflammatory disease. \n\nCT Abdomen/Pelvis ___. Diffuse anasarca with small bilateral pleural effusions and \nascites, but no evidence of abscess within the abdomen or \npelvis. \n2. Calcifications within the pancreatic head, and dilated \npancreatic tail \nducts, consistent with sequela of chronic pancreatitis.  No \nfocal fat stranding to suggest acute pancreatitis, however \ncorrelation with serum lipase and amylase is recommended. \n3. 6 mm hypodensity within the left kidney, which should be \nfollowed up with an outpatient ultrasound. \n4. T8 vertebral body compression fracture of indeterminate age. \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up ultrasound as an outpatient is \nrecommended for the 6 mm incompletely characterized hypodensity \nwithin the left kidney. \n\nEEG ___:\nAbnormal portable EEG study due to the continuous and symmetric \ndelta slowing, nonreactive to stimulation and devoid of state \ntransitions. \nThese findings are consistent with a moderately severe \nencephalopathy. The \nrecording cannot specify the etiology; infections, metabolic \ndisturbances, and medications are among the most common causes. \nThere were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic \nseizures. Shoulder twitching was not seen during this recording.\n\nRUQ US ___. No evidence of biliary dilatation. \n2. No focal liver lesions identified. \n3. Bilateral pleural effusion is incidentally noted. \n\nCT HEAD ___. No acute intracranial process. \n2. Slightly increased extensive paranasal sinus opacification, \nlikely related to current intubation. \n  \nTTE ___\nA septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial septum. \nNo atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, \ncolor Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is some \nDoppler signal within the device, which likely represents \nintra-device flow. Regional left ventricular wall motion is \nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal \n(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion \nare normal. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Well-seated Amplatzer atrial septal occluder without \nresidual interatrial flow.  \n\nCXR ___\nNew right-sided PICC line terminates ___ the mid SVC. \n\nCT HEAD ___.

Serum Tylenol 4, EtOH neg. Based on \nhistory, most likely ___ Tylenol toxicity, given pt took 1g Q2H \nx 26hours prior to arrival. Given INR >6.5 and pH <7.3 he had a \npoor prognosis based on ___ Criteria for \nAcetaminophen Toxicity, and met criteria for transplant workup.  \nHe was initiated on NAC, coagulopathy reversed as below, and \nlabs were trended q4-6 hours initially. Transplant surgery and \nhepatology were consulted. The patient was felt not to be a \ntransplant candidate given his critical illness. The patient's \nhemodynamics were supported and his liver function gradually \nimproved to ALT 53, AST 43, AP 247, TB 2.6, INR 1.0. The patient \nshould follow up with hepatology as outpatient for further \nmonitoring. \n\n# Septic Shock, E. Coli Bacteremia, Pseudomonas/Serratia/E.Coli \nPneumonia: Patient with soft SBPs on admission, worsened with \ninitiation of sedation after intubation. He was initiated on \nphenylephrine, transitioned to levophed once central access \nobtained. Blood cultures revealed GNRs and he was initiated on \nbroad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for \npresumed abdominal source.  Serial surveillance blood cultures \nwere obtained until blood cultures cleared. Abdominal ultrasound \nconcerning for cholecystitis, but absence of RUQ tenderness on \nadmission exam was reassuring. GNRs speciated to E. coli. The \npatient was started on cefepime, transitioned to ceftriaxone, \ntransitioned ultimately to ceftazidime, for which the patient \ncompleted a 2 week course. Patient was initiated on stress dose \nsteroids (on 20 mg prednisone as outpatient) which were \ngradually tapered back to his home dose. The patient's course \nwas complicated by progressive hypotension and pressor \nrequirement, with rising leukocytosis. He was evaluated with \nrepeated BCx, UCx, which were negative. Stool studies were \nnegative for C diff. CT abdomen and pelvis was without evidence \nof collection/abscess. Sputum culture showed pseudomonas, \nserratia, and E. coli. The patient was initiated on broad \nspectrum coverage, including vancomycin, cefepime and \nmetronidazole, narrowed ultimately to ceftazidime as above, \nwhich the patient will continue for 14 days through ___.  \n\n# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on ___ \nfor concern for tachypnea, imminent respiratory fatigue \nsecondary to severe metabolic acidosis, which was managed as \nbelow. The patient was found to have pneumonia as above - with \nsputum culture growing pseudomonas, serratia and E coli. He was \ntreated with antibiotics as above. There was thought to be some \ncomponent of volume overload ___ the setting of IVF \nresuscitation. Volume was managed with HD and intermittent \ndiuresis once renal function improved. The patient was extubated \non ___.  \n\n# Oliguric renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 with \ncreatinine peaking > 3 during admission, associated with \noliguria. The patient was evaluated with nephrology who felt \nthis was most likely secondary to ATN given hypotension \nrequiring pressors and no response with IVF.  Renal consulted \nand patient was initiated on CRRT on ___, transitioned to HD, \nwith gradual improvement ___ his renal function. A tunneled HD \nline was placed for access on ___ and ultimately removed once \nthe patient no longer needed dialysis. Cr at discharge 1.5 with \nstable electrolytes. \n\n# Cardiac Arrest: The patient was found to have labile blood \npressure and heart rate during hospitalization, with \nintermittent episodes of bradycardia. These episodes usually \noccurred ___ the setting of turning or stimulation related to \nrectal tube or ETT. On ___ the patient was noted to be \nbradycardic after turning, then had a long sinus pause/asysotle. \nHe was treated with 60 seconds of CPR with ROSC. The patient was \nevaluated by EP who suspected these episodes were related to \nhigh vagal tone related to these stimuli. The patient was \ntreated with a scopolamine patch with minimal improvement. There \nwere no further bradycardic episodes after removal of rectal \ntube and extubation. \n\n# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis \nfrom hypotension/poor liver clearance + renal failure.  He was \nstarted on bicarbonate gtt without significant improvement. \nRenal was consulted and given development of oliguria, worsening \nCr, and worsening acidosis, he was initiated on CRRT on ___ \nwith improvement ___ renal function as above.   \n\n# Coagulopathy: On admission, patient with INR of 11, PTT 48, \nfibrinogen of 56, plts of 23. Likely due to liver failure but \nclinical picture was also concerning for DIC. He was treated \nwith 1U PRBC, 4U FFP, 2U platelets, 4U cryoprecipitate, 10 mg IV \nvitamin K daily x 3 days with improvement. CBC, coags, \nfibrinogen were trended q4-6h and he was transfused an \nadditional 2U pRBCs throughout hospital course due to waxing and \nwaning anemia (see below).     \n\n# Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient was found to have drop ___ \nH/H ___ the setting of bleeding from HD tunneled line placed by \ninterventional radiology. The patient was evaluated by \ninterventional radiology who sutured area and performed gelfoam \nembolization of tunneled tract. The patient received 2U pRBCs \nfor bleeding during this time period with stabilization of H/H. \n\n# HTN: The patient's home lisinopril and diltiazem were held \ngiven hypotension on presentation. The patient's BP were found \nto be labile late ___ his hospital course, thought to be related \nto sympathetic stimulation following vagal episodes (as above). \nHTN was thought initially to be related to pain/sedation and the \npatient was treated with propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam. The \npatient's BP remained elevated despite adequate pain control and \nthe patient was started on hydralazine, transitioned to nitro \ngtt, transitioned to labetolol, titrated to 400mg PO q6hrs.  \nContinue to hold lisinopril ___ the setting of improving renal \nfunction. Continue to hold diltiazem given other nodal-blockage \nwith labetolol and given interaction with novel anticoagulants. \n\n# Acute on chronic pancreatitis: Abdominal pain started a day \nprior to admission at OSH. Imaging with stranding of \nperipancreatic fat and elevated lipase consistent with acute \npancreatitis. Unclear precipitant; denied alcohol use, no e/o \ngallstones on imaging. On admission to ___ denied any \nabdominal pain. Repeat CT abdomen and pelvis showed some \nresidual inflammation surrounding pancreas. Lipase was checked \nintermittently and found to be within normal limits. The patient \nwas restarted on his home pancreatic enzyme supplementation. \n\n# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy, Altered Mental Status: The \npatient was noted to have altered mental status during hospital \ncourse. He was evaluated with CT head which initially showed \nsome question of grey-white matter disruption on CT scan.  This \nwas repeated x2 without change. On further review, this question \nof grey-white matter disruption was felt to be nonspecific and \nlikely normal. The patient was evaluated with EEG which showed \ncontinuous and symmetric slowing c/w moderately severe \nencephalopathy; no epileptiform discharges. The patient was \nevaluated by neurology who felt the patient's altered mental \nstatus was multi-factorial ___ origin - related to hepatic \nencephalopathy, uremia and infection. The patient was also \nsuspected to have some underlying neurologic injuries related to \nhis history of alcohol use. He was also given multiple sedating \nmedications during his course with impaired hepatic and renal \nclearance. The possibility of meningitis was entertained and the \npatient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. \nUnable to obtain LP given the patient's sensitivity to vagal \nstimuli (as above) and lability of hemodynamics. There was \nultimately a low index of suspicion for meningitis as the \npatient's mental status spontaneously improved. The patient was \nextubated on ___ and weaned off sedation and found to be \nresponding appropriately to questions and without focal \nneurologic deficits. The patient's mental status was noted again \nto be altered following extubation ___ the setting of elevated BP \nsystolic >200. The patient was evaluated with CT head which \nshowed no acute changes. This was felt to be clinically \ncompatible with a diagnosis of PRES, given that his AMS resolved \nwith adequate BP control; however, CT was without imaging \nfindings of PRES.  He was treated with an antihypertensive \nregimen as above with improvement ___ his mental status. \n\n# Chronic pain: At home, takes dronabinol 2.5mg BID, gabapentin \n300mg TID, oxycodone 5mg Q6h prn (takes 4 times a day) for \nchronic pain of his leg. He does not have abdominal pain at \nbaseline. The patient was treated with sedation as above and \nthese home medications were held. The patient's gabapentin was \nheld at discharge given changing renal function. He was not \nrestarted on his home dronabinol at discharge, may consider \nrestarting as outpatient. \n\n# Prior EtOH abuse: Pt reported last drink was ___. \nAdmission tox screen at OSH was negative for alcohol. He was \nstarted on thiamine, folic acid, MVI.  \n\n# Depression: stopped home mirtazapine 30mg given hepatotoxicity\n\n# Hx of afib: ___ sinus on admission. At home, on diltiazem \n180mg, rivaroxaban 20mg. Home rivaroxaban held on admission, \ntransitioned to apixaban after resolution of coagulopathy given \nchanging renal function. Diltiazem was held, transitioned to \nlabetolol for rate control when BP stabilized. Consider holding \ndiltiazem indefinitely given interaction with novel \nanticoagulants. \n\n# H/o MI (___). Troponin neg x1 at OSH. EKG without evidence of \nischemia. ___ TTE with dilated RV but no RWMA. Aspirin held \non admission ___ the setting of thrombocytopenia and \ncoagulopathy. Restarted after resolution of these issues. \n\n# Prostate cancer: ___ 9, adenocarcinoma. Bone scans without \nmetastatic evidence (___). S/p Lupron injections, Casodex, and \nradiation, which were stopped at end of ___ due to intolerance. \nPSA ___ to 2.9 ___.  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- Continue to monitor blood pressure, on labetolol 400mg PO \nq6hrs with 10mg IV PRN SBP > 180. Continue to titrate BP \nmedications as needed. \n- Continue to monitor speech and swallowing. ___ need dobhoff \nfor nutrition and PO medications. \n- F/U with hepatology after discharge for further monitoring of \nliver function \n- F/U with nephrology as outpatient for further monitoring of \nrenal function \n- Continue ceftazidime IV for 14 day course for pseudomonas, \nserratia and E coli pneumonia through ___\n- Lisinopril was held ___ the setting of ___, F/U with nephrology \nwhen ok to restart. Per nephrology he should not resume this \nmedication for at least several weeks. \n- Home pain regimen was held given sedation and AMS. Continue to \ntitrate pain medications as needed. He should not resume Tylenol \nexcept under strictly monitored settings. \n- Rate control for atrial fibrillation switched for labetolol \nfrom diltiazem, consider holding off further diltiazem use given \ninteraction with apixaban particularly given changing renal \nfunction.\n- 3.6 mm hypodensity within the left kidney, which should be \nfollowed up with an outpatient ultrasound (from CT abd/pelvis \n___. \n- Repeat CXR ___ ___ weeks from completion of antibiotic course \nto ensure resolution of findings (due ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
