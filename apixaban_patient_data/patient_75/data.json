If any abdominal pain, \nfever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP \nfellow on call ___\n \nECHO:\nVery suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is normal in \nsize. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The \nleft ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function \nappears grossly normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free \nwall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly \ndilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is \nnot present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild bileaflet mitral \nvalve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is \nmild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no \npericardial effusion. There is a large anterior space which most \nlikely represents a prominent fat pad although a loculated \npericqardial effusion cannot be excluded with vertainty. There \nare no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year-old with hx of CHF (type unknown), HTN, PAF on Apixaban \nat baseline, GERD, Hypothyroid, Depression, Fibromyalgia, Lumbar \nspinal stenosis, cataract surgery (chronically keeps rt eye \nclosed per son since then) who presented to the BID-M ER from \nher nursing home complaining of fever, n/v, and abdominal pain.  \n\n\nDiagnoses:\nCholedocholithiasis\nAcute diastolic CHF\nAfib\nDepression\nGERD\nHypothyroidism\n\nShe was found to have choledocholithiasis with cbd stone and sl \ndilation of the cbd.\nCXR was neg for pneumonia.  She was given vancomycin and\nertapenem and transferred to our ED for ERCP.  In our ED she was\nfound to be hemodymaically stable, still had some ruq abd pain. \nNoted to have normal lactate (was elevated at BID-M on\npresentation).  She was admitted and ERCP team recommended \nholding\neliquis and plan for ercp the day following as could then \nconsider\nthat eliquis has been held long enough for one procedure\n(sphincterotomy and stone removal possibly).  This was done on \nwithout apparent complication.  Following this,  however \n(following cautious fluids the night after ercp) she developed \nan oxygen requirement and pretty dramatic CXR with effusions, \npulm edema,  and rales on exam all consistent with an \nexacerbation of heart failure.  Aggressively diuresed \nsubsequently over days with Lasix 20mg IV BID.   On \nciprofloxacin po following ERCP for biliary \ninfection/cholangitis and she completed a course.\n\nUltimately her lung exam and symptoms improved with IV diuresis. \n She was negative LOS about 3L.  Echo performed showed preserved \nheart function as above.  She was continued on her metoprolol \nand lisinopril.  She was transitioned to her Lasix 20mg daily.  \nShe was able to be weaned off oxygen, she was 90-93% on RA on \ndischarge though still taking oxygen for comfort.  You can use \n1L 02 as needed for comfort.  Part of her symptoms may also be \ndue to poor inspiratory effort as deep breathing exercises \nimproved her oxygenation.  Would continue to encourage deep \nbreathing.\n\nHer apixaban and other home medications were continued.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.
