On admission to the ED, he was noted to have an elevated\nwhite blood cell count, chest x-ray showing pneumonia and\npulmonary edema, and elevated ___. He had a mildly elevated\ntroponin, however normal CK-MB and has baseline elevated\ncreatinine. In the emergency department he also endorsed\nabdominal pain for which he received a NCCT. \n\nPt was recently admitted in ___ for mitral clip for severe\nmitral regurgitation after which he was discharged home. \nNotably,\npatient is currently full code which was verified by his\nhealthcare proxy. \n\nIn the ED:\n- Initial vital signs were notable for: T99.7, HR 70, BP 125/59,\nRR18, 99% on 3LNC\n- Exam notable for: Exam notable for lethargy, disorientation,\ninattention, asterixis.

There is a bidirectional color \nflow Doppler signal across the interatrial septum most c/w an \natrial septal defect. The estimated right atrial pressure is \n>15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy \nwith a mildly increased/dilated cavity. There is a small to \nmoderate area of regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction \nwith inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis (see schematic) and \npreserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. \nQuantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 39 % \n(normal 54-73%). There is no resting left ventricular outflow \ntract gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with \nmild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic sinus is mildly \ndilated with a mildly dilated ascending aorta. There is a normal \ndescending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are \nmildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is \nmild to moderate [___] aortic regurgitation. A MitraClip \nprosthesis is present. The MitraClip is attached to both \nleaflets, with thickened leaflets and restrained leaflet motion \nand normal mean gradient.

The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The \ntricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is \nmoderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic \nshadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be \nUNDERestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is a moderate circumferential pericardial \neffusion. In the presence of pulmonary artery hypertension, \ntypical echocardiographic findings of tamponade physiology may \nbe absent.\nIMPRESSION: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion. MIld \nto moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w \nCAD. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Well-seated \nMitraClip with normal transmitral gradient and at least moderate \neccentric mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate aortic \nregurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate \npulmonary hypertension.\n\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n==============\nPatient expired \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ male with history of CAD ___ MI and \nvfib arrest, HFrEF, COPD, lung cancer, on afib ___ PPM on AC and \nCKD who presenting with four days of fatigue, confusion, cough, \nand decreased PO intake found to have pneumonia and HF \nexacerbation admitted for diuresis and antibiotics.
