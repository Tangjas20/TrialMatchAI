Once treated for \nC.diff with oral vancomycin and when her glucose was under \nbetter control her nausea and vomiting resolved. She was very \ndeconditioned at discharge, but cleared by ___ to go home with \n___ and home ___.\n\n#NAUSEA/VOMITING C/F GASTROPARESIS FLARE: \nPt w/ h/o NIDDM c/b gastroparesis, reported a month of N/V i/s/o \nrecent fecal transplant for recurrent C. diff infection, p/w \nworsened vomiting and poor PO intake, now with frequent watery \nBMs noted after a few days inpatient (were soft but formed \nbefore that). Pt reports vomiting immediately after PO intake. \nExam w/\ndiffuse mild tenderness and slightly increased distension from \nprior, but otherwise benign. DDx was initially most likely viral \ngastroenteritis (though noro negative) triggering a \ngastroparesis flare. However, when loose stools started, c.diff \nwas checked, and positive, thought to be the cause. Poor blood \nglucose control may also be an exacerbating factors, as FSBG \nfrequently >200. Once C.diff treatment was started and patient \nhad tight glycemic control, her nausea and vomiting resolved. \n\n#PROTEIN CALORIE MALNUTRITION: \nPt cachectic appearing, with minimal PO intake >1 week. N/V \npoorly controlled, unable to tolerate POs. Previously seen \nelectrolyte abnormalities (low Mg, Phos, K) c/w malnutrition, \nbut risk of re-feeding syndrome was felt to be low. No feeding \ntube requirement. Nutrition recommended 100 mg thiamine x5 days \nwhich was done. \n\n#RECURRENT C DIFF INFECTION: \nPt w/ multiple loose BMs per day, C diff positive, so decided to \ntreat despite possibility of a false positive with the FMT so \nrecent (4 weeks prior). FMT was considered a failure and patient \nwill need to discuss with her outpatient GI providers. She was \ntreated with vancomycin Oral Liquid ___ mg PO/NG Q6H. \n\n#A-FIB WITH RVR: \nOn tele in Afib/Aflutter. HR's improved with IVF boluses. RVR \nlikely related to hypovolemia given N/V and inability to \ntolerate PO, dry appearing. Poor absorption of PO medications \nmay also be a factor. Patient stabilized on diltiazem 45 mg Q6H. \nVolume status very tenuous, even diuresis with 20 mg IV Lasix + \nher usual 20 mg PO Lasix one day sent her into RVR. Continued \nhome Apixaban 2.5 mg PO/NG BID \n\n#HFpEF: \nEcho in ___ with \"Preserved biventricular systolic function. \nMild mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension.\" Re-started home Lasix for SOB ___. As above, \nvolume status was very tenuous, even diuresis with 20 mg IV \nLasix + her usual 20 mg PO Lasix one day sent her into RVR. She \nwas satt'ing well on RA and breathing comfortably at the time of \ndischarge.\n\n#GERD & H/O DUODENAL ULCER: \nPt d/c omeprazole this past Novemeber. Per GI who saw her in \nclinic should switch to H2 blocker given increased risk of C. \ndiff recurrence w/ PPI. Pt continues to c/o heartburn. Started \nranitidine 150 mg PO daily.\n\n#HYPERTENSION: \nPt w/ h/o HTN. BPs were acceptable range for inpatient BP \ncontrol (mild to moderate HTN). Continued home Carvedilol 6.25 \nmg PO/NG BID.\n\n#INSOMNIA: \nPt c/o insomnia, not helped w/ ramaleteon, says only Zolpidem \nhas worked for her in the past. Continued home Zolpidem Tartrate \n5 mg PO QHS:PRN insomnia.\n\nCHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: \n===============================\n#NIDDM: \nH/o T2DM c/b gastroparesis. Last A1c in OMR is 6.0. Per pt was \non pioglitazone b/c other oral agents did not control her sugars \nwell, pt was counseled on risks of pioglitazone given HFpEF. \nLantus + HISS while inpatient. Held home Pioglitazone and \nrestarted at discharge. Consider switching to a new oral med in \nthe future given the patient's CHF. \n\n#CKD: \nBaseline Cr appeared to be 2.4. Most recent Cr of 2.6 on ___ \nin ___. Cr stable and below baseline (possibly ___ \nmalnutrition, or level of 2.0 is true baseline) at this time.\n\n#CHRONIC BACK PAIN: \nTakes dilaudid at home. After discussion with the patient, this \nmedication was help out of concern that it could be contributing \nto her nausea and vomiting. She did not have pain while in the \nhospital.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n====================================\nCODE STATUS: Full Code \nCONTACT: No healthcare proxy on file\n___ ___: 427\n_________________________\nFYI: \n- Patient's volume status is VERY tenuous. Giving her more than \nPO Lasix 20 mg in one day, regardless of her being slightly \nvolume overloaded, sent her into Afib RVR. \n- Increased dilt ER to 180 mg daily for rate control \n- Presentation concerning for failure of recent FMT. Discharged \non PO vancomycin. \n_________________________\nTO DO: \n[ ] Unless there is a contraindication, would strongly recommend \nswitching from pioglitazone to a sulfonylurea or other oral \ndiabetic medication, given that the patient has ?___. \n[ ] Check iron levels given anemia\n[ ] Please check renal function at next appointment, discharge \nCreatinine 2.6.
