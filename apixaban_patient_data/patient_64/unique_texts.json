She underwent a dynamic hip screw ORIF. After her procedure she was transferred to the medicine service for postoperative care. Her postoperative course was unremarkable and she was discharged to rehab on . ACUTE ISSUES # Left hip fracture s/p DHS ORIF: The patient presented to the emergency department and was evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture and was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service. The patient was taken to the operating room on for L hip DHS ORIF. Her procedure was notable for oscillating systolic pressures ranging from 50-170. After administration of vasopressors, her pressure normalized and the procedure was completed without further events. The patient was given antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. # Postoperative course: Pain control: Patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications. Her pain was controlled with PO Dilaudid PRN, IV dilaudid PRN, and gabapentin. Patient described her pain as a circumscribed burning pain of the leg. Patient did not require any IV dilaudid from and she was discharged on PO dilaudid q3h:prn and gabapentin. DVT prophylaxis: Patient was restarted on apixaban 5mg BID, her home dose, on POD1. She was discharged on her home dose of apixaban Nutrition: Patient progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. # ESRD/HD: Patient has a history of ESRD on HD. Patient continued to receive dialysis according to her normal TuThSat schedule throughout admission. Nephrology dialysis followed her. She was continued on sevelamer TID, nephrocaps, low Na/K/phos diet # SVT: Patient intermittently had episodes of short runs of SVT during dialysis. On patient had a run of sustained SVT during dialysis that required IV metoprolol. As a result she was kept on telemetry until . Tele overnight showed a runs of SVT (around 7, which lasted seconds to 1 minute) and questionable irregular rhythm with no known hx of atrial fibrillation. Patient asymptomatic. Patient normally in NSR and in NSR on discharge. On metoprolol 25 daily and apixaban (was on it initially after recent stroke). Atrius cardiology recommended changing dose to: metoprolol 25 mg BID. # s/p ischemic stroke: Patient has sustained two recent strokes. Her neurologic function remained at baseline throughout admission. Her apixaban 5mg BID was held for her surgery but restarted on POD#1. CHRONIC ISSUES # T2DM: Continued insulin sliding scale. # Rheumatoid arthritis: Continued home prednisone 5mg # HLD: Continued home atorvastatin 80mg. # Long QT syndrome: Continued home metoprolol XL 25mg and increased to 25 mg BID by time of discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Patient was started on dilaudid PO q3h:PRN for pain control postoperatively. Please wean as tolerated to avoid opioids with deliriogenic effects Patient needs followup for thyroid nodule. Per CT scan read: Further evaluation of multinodular thyroid with dominant 4.5 cm nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid is suggested by current ACR recommendations for incidentally noted thyroid nodules. Patient will follow-up with Dr. in clinic 14 days postoperatively Patient should follow up in clinic for interrogation Patient should follow up with her Atrius cardiologist on discharge. Her metoprolol was changed from 25 mg to 25 mg BID. # CODE: Full, confirmed # CONTACT: Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.
