He reports that the first day \npost-discharge he felt well, then subsequently the next day he \nwas filling out some business documents and realized that he had \ndifficulty doing the math which is unusual for him.  \n Patient notes that he had slurred speech starting earlier this \nmorning, unsure of time of onset. He went to his PCP and was \nreferred to the emergency department. Patient denies fevers, \nchills, chest pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, \nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He does note ecchymosis on his right \nfemoral arterial access after ablation. Has known 2 rib \nfractures on left from previous fall.  \n Per ED collateral from his family, he drinks ___ ETOH \nbeverages/night; stopped 11 days ago. Amiodarone was decreased \nto 100mg today due to patient's complaint of feeling fatigued.  \n The patient reports that he has been an alcoholic since his \nteens, but that he has been able to hide it from those around \nhim without getting into trouble. He finally stopped drinking \nprior to his PVI ablation but since that time he has been taking \nincreasing doses of diazepam at home.

Old left caudate head lacunar \ninfarct is noted.  Prominent ventricles sulci are compatible \nwith age-related involutional changes.\n There is mild mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid air \ncells and bilateral maxillary sinuses.  Mastoid air cells and \nmiddle ear cavities are well aerated. The bony calvarium is \nintact.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the bilateral \ncarotid siphons are noted.\n IMPRESSION:\n No intracranial hemorrhage or other acute intracranial \nabnormality.  Please note that MRI is more sensitive for the \ndetection of stroke.\n\n___ (PA & LAT)\nFINDINGS:\n The lungs are hyperinflated but clear without consolidation, \neffusion, or edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette stable \nwith moderate cardiomegaly.\n Median sternotomy wires are intact.

While there \nwas initial concern for facial droop, subsequent exam following \nadmission was nonfocal.  CT head without acute process. \nFollowing admission, additional history regarding patient's \nrecent use of benzodiazepines: following his ablation he had \nbeen prescribed diazepam to help him sleep.  He decided to use \nthis medication to help him avoid cravings for alcohol / avoid \nwithdrawal symptoms.  He took the diazepam at an increased \nfrequency, and also started using expired ativan that he found \nin his house.  Patient was seen by neurology who felt that his \nsymptoms were due to intoxication by benzodiazpines.  He did \nnot demonstrate any benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms and his \nmental status returned to baseline.\n\n# Accidental poisoning by Amiodarone, initial \n# Prolonged QT / Abnormal EKG\n# Atrial fibrillation\nOn presentation, patient was found to be bradycardic, with \nprolonged Qt>600ms with flattened twaves, all characteristic of \namiodarone toxicity.  Patient reported he may have gotten \nconfused about his amiodarone dose since his ablation in the \nsetting of benzodiazepines.  Case was discussed with his \nprimary electrophysiology team, who recommended stopping his \namiodarone.  Qtc improved to < 500ms over subsequent 48 hours.  \nNo events on telemetry.  Patient discharged with plan for \nprompt EP follow-up to discuss long-term rhythm control. \nContinued eliquis 5 mg bid.  \n\n___: \n# Hypertension\nAdmitted with Cr 1.5 from baseline 1.0 in setting of ___ PO \nintake secondary to encephalopathy above.  Lisinopril held and \npatient given IV fluids with improvement in Cr to 1.2. Would \nconsider recheck at follow-up visit. Restarted home \nlisinopril-HCTZ at discharge.\n\n# Alcohol abuse\nPatient revealed that he considered himself a \"functioning \nalcoholic\". \n Reported 6 drinks per day.  Denied prior withdrawal, but did \nreport that he had recently been taking benzodizepines as above \nto help with tapering his alcohol use.  He did not demonstrate \nsigns of withdrawal per CIWA protocol.  He was seen by social \nwork, counseled on cessation, and provided with outpatient \nresources for continued abstinence.  \n\n# Abnormal TSH value\nTSH was sent as part of admission encephalopathy workup, \nreturning at 14, with a free T4 within normal range at 1.1.  It \nwas felt this could represent acute vs chronic amiodarone \ntoxicity vs other.  Given his mental status resolved to \nbaseline without need to initiate thyroid replacement, felt \nthat urgent intervention was not indicated.  Would consider \nrechecking once off amiodarone and/or initiating replacement \ntherapy.\n\n# T2DM: Metformin was held initially on admission. The patient \nwas kept on an insulin sliding scale, and discharge on his \nprevious metformin. \n\n# HLD: gemfibrozil was continued.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Amiodarone stopped due to toxicity above; patient agreed to \nschedule close follow-up with Dr. ___ restarting \nit. Would check EKG at follow-up. \n- Would consider alcohol cessation counseling\n- Consider rechecking TSH as above\n- Held lisinopril at discharge due to resolving ___ would \nconsider recheck of Cr at follow-up before restarting\n# CODE: full (confirmed)  \n# CONTACT: ___, wife, ___ (home) ___ \n(cell)  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
