  "12645102-DS-3": "MEDICINE Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions Attending: . Chief Complaint: Confusion Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none History of Present Illness: with recent ablation for atrial fibrillation on Eliquis presenting with lethargy, confusion, slurred speech. His symptoms have been ongoing for days since discharge from PVI ablation on . He reports that the first day post-discharge he felt well, then subsequently the next day he was filling out some business documents and realized that he had difficulty doing the math which is unusual for him. Patient notes that he had slurred speech starting earlier this morning, unsure of time of onset. He went to his PCP and was referred to the emergency department. Patient denies fevers, chills, chest pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He does note ecchymosis on his right femoral arterial access after ablation. Has known 2 rib fractures on left from previous fall. Per ED collateral from his family, he drinks ETOH beverages/night; stopped 11 days ago. Amiodarone was decreased to 100mg today due to patient's complaint of feeling fatigued. The patient reports that he has been an alcoholic since his teens, but that he has been able to hide it from those around him without getting into trouble. He finally stopped drinking prior to his PVI ablation but since that time he has been taking increasing doses of diazepam at home. He ran out of diazepam and then started taking an expired Ativan prescription that he had at home. He is worried about his behavior and wants to have help.

Old left caudate head lacunar infarct is noted. Prominent ventricles sulci are compatible with age-related involutional changes. There is mild mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and bilateral maxillary sinuses. Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are well aerated. The bony calvarium is intact. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons are noted. IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or other acute intracranial abnormality. Please note that MRI is more sensitive for the detection of stroke. (PA & LAT) FINDINGS: The lungs are hyperinflated but clear without consolidation, effusion, or edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette stable with moderate cardiomegaly. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Lateral likely ninth rib fracture is noted with suggestion of callus formation. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process. Left lateral likely ninth rib fracture noted with probable adjacent callus formation identified, however to be correlated clinically regarding acuity. Brief Hospital Course: This is a year old male with past medical history of alcohol abuse, ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic insufficiency status post repair, hypertension, persistent atrial fibrillation status post recent pulmonary vein isolation ablation , admitted with several days of confusion secondary to benzodiazepine intoxication and EKG changes secondary amiodarone toxicity, improving with holding benzodiazpine and amiodarone, able to be discharged home. # Acute toxic encephalopathy # Accidental poisoning by benzodiazepines, initial Patient who is status post a recent pulmonary vein isolation ablation for atrial fibrillation who presented with several days of lethargy, confusion and slurred speech. While there was initial concern for facial droop, subsequent exam following admission was nonfocal. CT head without acute process. Following admission, additional history regarding patient's recent use of benzodiazepines: following his ablation he had been prescribed diazepam to help him sleep. He decided to use this medication to help him avoid cravings for alcohol / avoid withdrawal symptoms. He took the diazepam at an increased frequency, and also started using expired ativan that he found in his house. Patient was seen by neurology who felt that his symptoms were due to intoxication by benzodiazpines. He did not demonstrate any benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms and his mental status returned to baseline. # Accidental poisoning by Amiodarone, initial # Prolonged QT / Abnormal EKG # Atrial fibrillation On presentation, patient was found to be bradycardic, with prolonged Qt>600ms with flattened twaves, all characteristic of amiodarone toxicity. Patient reported he may have gotten confused about his amiodarone dose since his ablation in the setting of benzodiazepines. Case was discussed with his primary electrophysiology team, who recommended stopping his amiodarone. Qtc improved to < 500ms over subsequent 48 hours. No events on telemetry. Patient discharged with plan for prompt EP follow-up to discuss long-term rhythm control. Continued eliquis 5 mg bid. : # Hypertension Admitted with Cr 1.5 from baseline 1.0 in setting of PO intake secondary to encephalopathy above. Lisinopril held and patient given IV fluids with improvement in Cr to 1.2. Would consider recheck at follow-up visit. Restarted home lisinopril-HCTZ at discharge. # Alcohol abuse Patient revealed that he considered himself a \"functioning alcoholic\". Reported 6 drinks per day. Denied prior withdrawal, but did report that he had recently been taking benzodizepines as above to help with tapering his alcohol use. He did not demonstrate signs of withdrawal per CIWA protocol. He was seen by social work, counseled on cessation, and provided with outpatient resources for continued abstinence. # Abnormal TSH value TSH was sent as part of admission encephalopathy workup, returning at 14, with a free T4 within normal range at 1.1. It was felt this could represent acute vs chronic amiodarone toxicity vs other. Given his mental status resolved to baseline without need to initiate thyroid replacement, felt that urgent intervention was not indicated. Would consider rechecking once off amiodarone and/or initiating replacement therapy. # T2DM: Metformin was held initially on admission. The patient was kept on an insulin sliding scale, and discharge on his previous metformin. # HLD: gemfibrozil was continued. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Amiodarone stopped due to toxicity above; patient agreed to schedule close follow-up with Dr. restarting it. Would check EKG at follow-up. Would consider alcohol cessation counseling Consider rechecking TSH as above Held lisinopril at discharge due to resolving would consider recheck of Cr at follow-up before restarting # CODE: full (confirmed) # CONTACT: , wife, (home) (cell) Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. , You were admitted to the hospital with confusion as well as difficulty calculating numbers. You were evaluated with blood work, imaging, and tests looking at your heart including EKGs. There was some evidence that there was too much amiodarone in your system, and it was having an effect on your heart, your thyroid, and possibly your thinking. We kept you off the amiodarone and your symptoms gradually improved. There was also some concern that you were experiencing some degree of this confusion from the valium and Ativan you were taking at home. We appreciate your efforts to try to discontinue your alcohol use. We hope you have the ability to look into social work resources with your primary care doctor to help you accomplish your goal of avoiding alcohol and benzodiazepines. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. also with your primary care doctor within the coming week. Please do not go back onto the amiodarone of valium/Ativan until you have an opportunity to talk to your outpatient doctors. was a pleasure to be involved with your care at !
