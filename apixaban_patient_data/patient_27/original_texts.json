Multiple nondilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel in the \nmid abdomen are noted.  Findings are compatible with enteritis. \n2. ___ nodular opacities at the right lung base likely \nrepresent an infectious process. \n3. There is intermediate to high density material within the \nendometrial \ncanal.  Recommend nonemergent pelvic ultrasound for further \nevaluation.  \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent pelvic ultrasound. \n\n___ - CXR\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall \nchange.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent \nwith chronic pulmonary disease.  Mild basilar atelectasis, but \nno acute pneumonia.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits \nand there is no evidence of appreciable vascular congestion. \nOld healed fracture of the midportion of the right clavicle is \nseen. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF SUMMARY:\n\n___ hx COPD, HTN, HLD, PE in ___ (provoked by travel, on \napixaban) presenting with four days of fevers, diarrhea, and \ndyspnea and was found to have ___, elevated LFTs, pancytopenia, \nand e/o of community acquired pneumonia. Significant workup to \ndetermine the cause has not revealed a unifying diagnosis, but \nmultiple studies remain pending and the diarrhea has resolved \nand pancytopenia improving. \n\n============================\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n# Fever\n# Diarrhea/Enteritis\n# Elevated Liver enzymes\n# Pancytopenia, now resolving (pancytopenia differential below)\n At the time of discharge there were no positive culture or \nserology results. Highest on the differential are viral \ninfection or pneumonia leading to bone marrow suppression or \nbrief ITP, however patient noted on the day prior to discharge \nthat she remembers pulling a possible tick off of her head in \nthe prior weeks walking her dog, thus tickborne illness such as \nlyme or anaplasma are also possibilities (serologies pending). \nFor this reason, and given her pneumonia as noted below, she was \ntreated in the hospital with Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin (should \ncover most tickborne illness) and at discharge transitioned to \nDoxycycline 100mg BID for 11 additional days for total 2 week \ncourse. This should allow for both community acquired pneumonia \ntreatment, atypical pneumonia treatment such as mycoplasma and \ntreatment of a variety of tickborne illnesses. Her counts were \nrecovering at time of discharge and should be re-checked after \ndischarge. \nPlatelets on discharge had trended from low ___ to 63. \n- F/u lyme, anaplasma, CMV, EBV, HIV\n- Continue abx as above\n- If continued thrombocytopenia, f/u with Dr. ___ for \npossible BM biopsy to rule out MDS. \n\nLABS:\n___ 1:40 (weakly positive (30% of the population with 1:40)\nCardiolipin IgG/IgM Neg\nB2 Glycoprotein IgG/IgM Neg\nMycoplasma PNA IgM Neg\nAcute hepatitis panel (A,B,C) Neg\nAnaplasma IgM Neg\nTSH 0.28\nHIV Neg\nFibrinogen 154\nPeripheral smear - toxic granulocytes, no schistocytes\nStool studies/cdiff neg\n\n# CAP\n# Acute exacerabation of severe COPD:\nPatient with hx of severe COPD, GOLD stage ___, last FEV1 31%. \nPresented with increased dyspnea from baseline, and requiring \n___ NC. Exam with moderately reduced air flow, wheezing c/w COPD \nexacerbation. CT A&P with e/o tree and ___ opacities in RLL. \nHypoxia likely multifactorial with PNA and COPD triggered by \nPNA. Started on IV CTX 1g q24hr (D1 ___ and Azithro 250 mg \nPO q24hr (D1 ___. At the time of discharge, patient was \ngiven 11 days of Doxycycline 100mg BID to complete a 14 day \ncourse to cover for both tick borne illness and for community \nacquired pneumonia. \nAfter discharge f/u mycoplasma, continue home respiratory \nmedications. Patient was not given steroids, but if worsening \nrespiratory status can consider these as outpatient. Legionella \nand mycoplasma was negative\n- F/u with outpatient pulmonologist\n\n# Thrombocytopenia: \n# Anemia:\n# Leukopenia, now resolved\nPlts 33, WBC 3.6, Hgb 10.6 on admission. INR 1.3, PTT normal. \nDiff with 1 atypical. Most likely BM suppression iso acute viral \nillness; retic count 0.6 iso anemia c/w suppressed marrow. \nPossibly consumptive iso CMV or EBV, though no splenomegaly. \nTTP/HUS unlikely with no schistocytes on smear (which was read \nby the primary team, hematopathology and ___ ___ \nconsultant) and high haptoglobin. Unlikely HIT as last heparin \nwas in ___. ITP possible though no new meds except for \numeclidinium-vilanterol. Malignancy/BM infiltrative processes \nless likely given smear w/evidence more suggestive of infection \n(toxic granules present in PMNs). Leukopenia resolved ___, \nanemia stable throughout hospitalization. Platelets increased on \n___ and ___ and were 63 at time of discharge.\n- Repeat labs on ___ to look for continued improvement, \nmay need hematology/oncology f/u if persistent\n\n# Enteritis: Unclear source. CT A&P with evidence of enteritis. \nMost likely viral, also considering C dif, parasites. Considered \nEHEC with c/f HUS but no schistocytes on smear. On arrival to \nED, patient's VS showed signs of volume depletion, improved with \nIVF. HypoNa, HypoK initially also improved with IVF and K \nrepletion. C dif, Norovirus negative. Some stool studies \nremained pending at discharge. Prior to discharge her enteritis \nhad resolved. \n- F/u stool studies (see transitional issue)\n \n# Transaminitis: Relatively mild. Her LFTs were improving prior \nto discharge, however a unifying diagnosis was still pending at \ndischarge. It is possible that her transaminitis is in the \nsetting of viral infection or bacterial infection such as \nmycoplasma. Multiple studies pending at the time of discharge to \nassess the cause, as well as repeat lab testing on ___. \n___ was 1:40 but this is seen in 20% of healthy individuals and \nwas not further pursued. \n- Repeat LFTs as outpatient\n\n# Hx PE: Pt had provoked subsegmental PE in ___, on apixaban \nat home. Did not take apixaban x5 days prior to hospitalization \nduring illness. There was no indication of new PE this admission \ndespite the gap in treatment. Patient placed on heparin gtt \nafter admission, and then restarted on Apixiban 5mg BID as \nplatelets recovered. Per ___ sent a hypercoaguable workup \nwhich was pending at discharge (see transitional issues).\n- No indication for new PE ___ DVT, would recommend completing \n___ of anticoagulation for provoked PE then \ntrialing off anticoagulation.\n\n# Essential HTN- controlled: Stable. Held HCTZ at discharge \ngiven normotensive, did not require during hospitalization.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:  \n# HLD: Stable. Continued home ASA 81, atorvastatim 40 mg.\n# Chronic pain: Stable. Held celecoxib given ___, can restart at \ndischarge.\n# Allergies: Stable. Continued home cetirizine\n# Osteopenia: Stable.
