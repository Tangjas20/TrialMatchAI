Evaluation of \nthe heart size is limited in the setting of low lung volumes, \nhowever does not appear significantly enlarged.  There is \npulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  A \nsmall more focal opacity adjacent to the left hilum may \nrepresent a engorged pulmonary vasculature and overlying \nexternal artifact, however an early pneumonia is difficult to \nexclude.  No large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Median \nsternotomy wires are present. \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Low lung volumes with pulmonary vascular congestion. No frank \npulmonary \nedema. \n2. Small more focal opacity adjacent to the left hilum may \nrepresent engorged pulmonary vasculature and overlying external \nartifact, however early pneumonia is difficult to exclude.\n\nEXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD (___)\n  \nFINDINGS:  \nThere is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  \nThere is \nprominence of the ventricles and sulci, as expected for a.  \nSubcortical and periventricular white matter hypodensities are \nnonspecific, however likely represent sequela of chronic small \nvessel ischemic disease.  There are atherosclerotic \ncalcifications in the bilateral cavernous carotids and \nvertebral arteries. There is no evidence of fracture.  There is \nmild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.  The \nvisualized portion of the remainder of the paranasal sinuses, \nmastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The \nvisualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION:   \nNo evidence of mass, hemorrhage or infarction.\n\nEXAMINATION:  CTA CHEST WITH CONTRAST (___)\n  \nFINDINGS:   \nHEART AND VASCULATURE: Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified \nto the \nsubsegmental level without filling defect to indicate a \npulmonary embolus, \nwith evaluation of the lingular segmental and subsegmental \nbranches slightly limited by respiratory motion in that area.  \nThe thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of \ndissection or intramural hematoma.  The heart is mildly \nenlarged.  Patient is status post CABG.  There are diffuse \ncoronary artery calcifications in the native coronary arteries.  \nNo pericardial effusion is seen.  Median sternotomy wires are \nnoted. \n \nAXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: No axillary, mediastinal, or \nhilar lymphadenopathy is present.  No mediastinal mass. \n  \nPLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. \n  \nLUNGS/AIRWAYS: There are small homogeneously enhancing \nconsolidations at the bilateral lung bases consistent with \natelectasis.  The airways are patent to the level of the \nsegmental bronchi bilaterally. \n  \nBASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show \nno abnormality. \n  \nABDOMEN: Few subcentimeter hypodensities in the liver are \nincompletely \ncharacterized, however statistically likely represent hepatic \ncysts or biliary hamartomas. Included portion of the upper \nabdomen is unremarkable. \n  \nBONES: There are degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  No \nsuspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no acute \nfracture. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. \n2. Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis. \n\nEEG on ___\nIMPRESSION: This was an abnormal routine EEG showed a normal \nbackground due to absence of posterior dominant rhythm \nindicative of mild encephalopathy nonspecific as to etiology. \nDiffuse anteriorly predominant alpha and excessive beta activity \ncan be seen with medication effect. There were no focal \nfindings, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures. \n  \nTTE on ___\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nmild regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with single \nvessel coronary artery disease (PDA distribution). No valvular \npathology or pathologic flow identified.\n\nEXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT (___)\nIMPRESSION:   \nCompared to chest radiographs, ___. \nLungs are low in volume but clear of any focal abnormality.  \nPulmonary \nvasculature is borderline engorged, but heart size is normal and \nthere is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  No \npneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the region of the superior \ncavoatrial junction. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nASSESSMENT & PLAN: \n___ male with history of asthma, type 2 diabetes, CAD \ns/p CABG ___, afib on apixaban, hypertension, and prostate \ncancer (on lupron) who was admitted with somnolence and dyspnea, \nfound to have high fever and hyponatremia w/ ___.

Was empirically \nstarted on vanc/cefepime with subsequent improvement. TTE \nwithout vegetations; TEE and LP deferred per ID team. Blood cx \ngrew Strep mitis/oralis. Was narrowed to CTX. Urine cx growing \nalpha hemolytic colonies; likely spillover from blood per ID. \nMRSA swab negative. Given severe initial presentation, it was \ndecided by ID to treat empirically with 4 week course. PICC was \nplaced and pt was discharged on CTX 2g q24h for 4 week course, \nset to end on ___. Pt has planned follow-up with outpt ID and \nwill undergo weekly labs per their team.\n\n# Encephalopathy\nPt presented with AMS and difficulty breathing, found to be \nfebrile to 104.8 with labs notable for Na 128.

Pt was diuresed with IV Lasix \nlater in course and was discharged on his home Lasix.\n\n# LFT Abnormalities\nLFTs were normal on admission. However, incr to ALT 68, AST 231, \nnl Alk Phos and TBili.after initiation of abx with \nhepatocellular pattern of injury. Likely drug-induced I/s/o high \ndose abx therapy.
