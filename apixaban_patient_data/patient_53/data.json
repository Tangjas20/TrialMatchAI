Presented to ___ at beginning of\n___ with cough and progressive dyspnea and ? orthopnea. Chest\nxray that was done initially in ER was negative for PNA. He was\ntreated with a course of Levaquin and supportive tx with\nRobitussin, tesselon perles and bronchodilators. NT-proBNP was\nelevated at 3172. He notes that they though he was volume\noverloaded and gave him some Lasix upon initial presentation \nwith\nno significant improvement. Ultimately did have CT chest which\nrevealed multiple calcified pulmonary nodules, right \nparatracheal\nLAD of unclear significance and dilated esophagus with mild wall\nthickening. Also noted was an ill-defined soft tissue fullness \nin\nregion of the pancreaticoduodenal groove. Given this abnormality\nhad CT abd/pelvis that revealed a 7.5 x 4.5 x 6.5 cm mass in the\npancreaticoduodenal groove which was inseparable from the\npancreatic head. There was also some surrounding \nlymphadenopathy.\nHe was evaluated locally during this hospitalization by oncology\nand GI who recommended biopsy. The initial concern was for\npancreatic cancer. He had verbalized that he wanted to have that\nprocedure done at ___ as the rest of his medical care was \nhere.\nHe was referred to Dr. ___ did an biopsy on ___ via\nendoscopic ultrasound which revealed scant fragments of intact\nlymphoid tissue with morphologic and immunophenotypic features \nof\nB-Cell Lymphoma; Germinal Center Phenotype. By\nimmunohistochemistry, CD20 highlights the vast majority of the\nlymphoid population which is also immunoreactive for CD10, BCL6\nand BCL2 (bright expression seen). CD3 highlights scattered\nbackground small T-cells. MUM1 is negative. CD21 reveals no\nevidence of follicular dendritic cell meshwork. A Ki-___\nimmunostain reveals a low proliferation fraction which is\nestimated to be ___ overall. In-situ hybridization for\n___ virus encoded RNA ___ ISH) is negative.\nCorresponding flow cytometry revealed involvement by a \npopulation\nof B-cells showing co-expression of CD10 and cytoplasmic lambda\nlight chain restriction (see separate report ___ for full\nresults). The differential diagnosis primarily includes\nfollicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\n\nHe had a repeat biopsy with a core and again revealed follicular\nlymphoma cytologic grade ___ with some areas of high\nproliferation up to 60%. Cytogenetics POSITIVE for IGH/BCL2 but\notherwise high grade lymphoma panel was negative. PET-CT \nrevealed\nthe known large abdominal FDG avid nodal mass surrounding small\nbowel loops without evidence of bowel obstruction (D5). Multiple\nother mesenteric FDG avid lymph nodes as well as FDG avid\nhypodense lesion along the posterior aspect of the spleen. FDG\navid mesenteric adenopathy including subcarinal adenopathy.\nMultiple FDG avid foci involving the bony pelvis and right\nposterior ninth rib. Also, noted to have a 1.0 x 0.8 cm FDG avid\nright paratracheal lymph node (SUV max: 6.3).  A nearby\nsubcarinal lymph node is also FDG avid measuring 1.2 x 0.9 cm\n(SUV max: 6.1).

Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis with no acute \nchange.\nStarted on prednisone 40mg x 2 days and allopurinol. Had ? some\nTLS with mild bump in creatinine as well as bump in potassium\nlevel. Managed with IV and po hydration. Continues on the\nallopurinol. Creatinine and potassium improved. Clinically\nimproved after the prednisone. He ultimately initiated his first\ncycle of chemotherapy with Bendamustine alone on ___ \n(Rituxan\nheld).\n\nPatient's first cycle was complicated by an admission presenting\nwith fevers, cough and dyspnea with an O2 requirement. He was\nfound to have parainfluenza 3. In this setting had a COPD\nexacerbation. He ultimately was discharged home. Of note the\nRituxan was held with his first cycle in the setting of this\nadmission. His ___ cycle of R-Bendamustine was delayed by 1 week\nto allow more time to recover from the parainfluenza. He\nultimately initiated his ___ cycle on ___. He tolerated his\nfirst Rituxan well with no infusional reactions. He had a PET-CT\nafter two cycles on ___ which revealed a dramatic response \nthough\nstill with some ? small area of residual FDG avid disease in \nmain\nabdominal mass. He completed 4 cycles in ___. Fourth cycle \nwas\ncomplicated by admission for PNA requiring BIPAP for brief \nperiod\nand short ICU stay. Patient with COPD exacerbation in this\nsetting as well  He had a repeat PET-CT on ___ which revealed\nongoing disease response in his abdomen. Decision made to hold\noff on further Bendamustine to limit toxicity. Repeat imaging\nsince that time with no disease recurrence.
