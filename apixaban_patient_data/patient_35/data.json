Pt intermittently endorsed dysuria, which has \nresolved. The course has been complicated by urinary retention \nwhich may be multifactorial secondary to recent stroke and \nmucosal irritation from urinary tract infection.\n- Continue ciprofloxacin (P.vulagris sensitive) until ___ \n\n#Atrial fibrillation w/ RVR, paroxysmal \nOn ___ pt was found to be in Afib w/ RVR and rates in the \n120s, this initially responded well to 25mg of PO metoprolol. \nShe was thought to be possibly mildly hypovolemic and given 500c \nIVF. She reverted back to sinus rhythm w/ HRs in the ___ on \n___. She was started on apixaban 2.5mg daily for \nanticoagulation given high risk for recurrent cardioembolic \nstroke after discussion with family. \n\n#HypoNa \nPt presenting with hypoNa to 131 on admission from previous \ndischarge Na of 130. Etiology of this is still somewhat unknown. \nGiven her mental status, possibly decreased PO intake and \ninfection it was thought that she may be hypovolemic and her \nsodium responded intermittently to IVF. Her Na uptrended w/o \nintervention to 134 prior to discharge. \n\n#HTN/HLD \nLosartan held following previous admission to allow for \npermissive hypertension s/p stroke..

She was also started on \namlodipine 5mg daily. \n- Despite recent stroke her blood pressure goal should be \nnormotension, SBP <150 \n\n#Fall \nPt fell from sitting height had R. head strike, no LOC. No c/f \nfor acute intracranial bleed on CTH. Etiology of fall is most \nlikely mechanical ___ imbalance from chronic medical issues. \n- ___ consulted and recommending continued rehab \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#Recent L.Midbrain infarct \nRecent hospitalization for acute L.midbrin infarct, thought to \nbecardiolembolic in origin (though no definite nidus on \nTTE),family did not want anticoagulation initially. However on \nrepeat discussion with the family the decision was made to \ninitiabe apixaban 2.5mg. Pt still w/ complete L.ptosis, minimal \nextraocular movement of left (no abduction or adduction), \npossible RUE weakness though difficult to assess given mental \nstatus. \n- Continued ASA 81 \n- Simvastatin 40 switched to Atorvastatin 40 \n- Increased Losartan as above \n\n#Dementia,\n#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy \nPt presenting w/ poor baseline cognition most likely \nrepresenting chronic cognitive decline in the setting of known \ndementia. However, this may have been acutely worsened given \nrecent recent infectious and vascular insults as above. Pt \nlargely only oriented to person and location (ie. hospital) this \nadmission. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
