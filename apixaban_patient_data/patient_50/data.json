The right atrium is \nmarkedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF = 50%). There \nis abnormal septal motion suggestive of pericardial \nconstriction. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus \nlevel. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial \nmitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial \neffusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. The \necho findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial \nconstriction. \n\nCXR (___)\nNear complete collapse of the right lower lobe with loculated \nright pleural effusion is not appreciably changed on radiographs \nfrom multiple prior studies dating back to ___, but is \nbetter assessed on the dedicated same day CTA chest. \n\nBILATERAL ___ ULTRASOUND (___)\n1. The right and left peroneal veins were not detectable. \nOtherwise, no \nevidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower \nextremity veins. \n2. Subcutaneous edema noted in both the right and left calf. \n\nCTA CHEST (___)\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic \nabnormality. \n2. Interval progression of complete right lower lobe collapse as \nwell as \nmediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy since ___. \n\n3. Multifocal ground-glass opacities in the left lung with \ninterval increase in small left pleural effusion likely \nrepresents component of superimposed pulmonary edema. \n4. Loculated right pleural effusion, right pleural and right \nchest wall \ntumoral deposits, mild pericardial effusion, and multiple lytic \nand expansile osseous metastasis appear similar to the prior \nexam in ___. \n5. Redemonstration of partially visualized celiac axis nodal \nmass. \n6. Partially visualized intra-abdominal ascites may be slightly \nincreased \nsince the prior study. \n\nNON-CONTRAST CT HEAD (___)\n1. No acute intracranial abnormalities.  Please note MRI of the \nbrain is more sensitive for the detection of acute infarct. \n2. Please note contrast brain MRI is more sensitive for the \nevaluation of \nintracranial metastatic disease. \n3. Paranasal sinus disease , as described. \n4. Atrophy, probable small vessel ischemic changes, and \natherosclerotic \nvascular disease as described. \n\nANKLE/FOOT XRAY (___)\nNo fracture or dislocations are seen around the left foot or \nankle. There are no significant degenerative changes.  The \nmortise is congruent on these nonweight bearing views.  The \ntibial talar joint space is preserved and no talar dome \nosteochondral lesion is identified. No suspicious lytic or \nsclerotic lesion is identified.  No soft tissue calcification or \nradiopaque foreign body is identified.  There is soft tissue \nswelling noted around the ankle. \n\nCXR (___)\n1. Mild interval increase in the right loculated pleural \neffusion.  In tandem with the mild enlargement of heart size, \nthe development of early pulmonary edema is possible. \n2. Unchanged near complete collapse of the right lower lung. \n3. Mild interval increase in left lower lung atelectasis. \n\nTTE (___)\nThe left ventricular cavity size is normal. Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve \nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. \nThere is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without \ndefinite echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Ascites is \npresent. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ ___ s/p r nephrectomy c/b metastatic pleural nodules & \nmalignant pericardial effusion s/p pericardial drains, on \nnivolumab, who presented with ___ erythema & worsening \northopnea, treated initially as cellulitis subsequently felt to \nbe traumatic purpura but hospital course c/b TTE findings \nsuggestive of pericardial constriction, fluid overload, \nhypotension and c/f infection of uncertain source. He developed \nanuric renal failure likely in the setting of persistent \nhypotension, and given his multiorgan failure and terminal \ncancer diagnosis, the patient and his family expressed a clear \npreference to transition his care to comfort measures only. \n\n# GOC\nGiven his multiorgan failure, terminal cancer diagnosis, and \nlack of remaining medical options to potentially alter his \nprognosis, ___ expressed a clear desire to transition his \ncare to comfort-focused care.

He spent time with his family on \nthe day before his death, and died overnight into ___. He was \npronounced dead at 4:05 am. His family was informed, and they \nexpressed gratitude over the care he had received.\n\n# Pericardial Effusion\n# Constrictive pericardial disease\nEffusion likely malignant c/w prior, presently no e/o tamponade \nphysiology by echo but pulsus has been elevated as high as 18. \nPericardiocentesis ___, pericardiotomy ___. TTE from \n___ with constrictive pericardial disease likely secondary to \nboth metastatic disease and multiple previous procedures. \nStopped monitoring vitals after transition to CMO.\n\n# RCC s/p r nephrectomy c/b metastasis, multiple failed regimens\nPreviously on Nivolumab (C2D1 = ___. Had recently been on \nAxitinib. After his transition to CMO, he was treated \nsymptomatically for his pain, anxiety, and dyspnea.\n\n# Shock\nMultifactorial; likely obstructive due to constrictive \npericardium, possibly septic. Discontinued antibiotics and \nalbumin after transition to CMO.\n\n# Malignant Ascites\nPatient had significant abdominal ascites secondary to diffuse \nmetastatic disease. s/p dx and tx paracentesis ___, without e/o \nSBP by cell count. 4L removed, with 25g albumin post-procedure.\n\n# HFpEF\nExam consistent with fluid overload. However, diuresis made more \nchallenging by constrictive pericardium. Discontinued supportive \nalbumin after care was transitioned to CMO, as above.\n\n# Leukocytosis w/left shift\nUnclear source, but considered UTI vs PNA vs SSTI vs SBP. \nNotably afebrile throughout course. Discontinued ABX with shift \nin care to CMO.\n\n# Anuric ___\nCr 4.1 on last check, up from b/l 0.9, now anuric. New during \nhospitalization, developed during periods of hypotension and as \npatient was increasing in weight. Suspect ATN from hypotension \nvs cardiogenic.
