Hypercoagulability is new, could be \nfurther provoked by the IVC filter itself but she was forming \nclots before that, raising concern especially with recent head \nCT incidental finding that she could have recurrence of her \ncancer. APLS workup notable for low positive cardiolipin IgG, \nwill need to repeat in 12 weeks to confirm diagnosis.
