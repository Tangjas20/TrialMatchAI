He was recognized by a police officer as having \nwarrants and taken into custody. For unclear reasons, he was not \naccepted at the ___ facility where he was taken into \ncustody and transferred to the ED for evaluation of his leg \nwounds. He remains in custody.\n\nIn the ED he complained of worsening left leg pain that has been \nprogressing for the last ___ months. He has had difficulty and \npain with use of his leg since discharge, but denied any new \ntrauma. He has continued to be homeless using IV heroin and \nmethamphetamine, last ___ morning. Patient was admitted on \n___ to the TSICU for airway watch after sedation in the ED. \nAntibiotics were started after discussion with ID (ceftz/vanc) \nand narrowed to ceftriaxone, during the course of the morning \npatient remained breathing comfortably on RA, did not require \nintubation and was found ready to be transferred to the floor. \nPatient was no longer agitated and remained somnolent during \nTSICU stay. He was transferred to medicine on ___ ___.\n\nOn the floor he was treated with antibiotics for his ___ \ncellulitis and monitored for opiate and alcohol withdrawal with \n___ police in the room. He had one blood culture positive for \nGPCs and was started on vancomycin. However, this resulted as \nCoNS and thought to be contaminant. Wound culture grew MRSA so \nwas transitioned to doxy for cellulitis. His course was \ncomplicated by intermittent refusal of lab draws and blood \ncultures.\n\n=========================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n========================\n[] Extensive history of IV methamphetamine and opiate use \ndisorder. Please continue to counsel patient on cessation IVDU.\n[] Has known history of HIV, CD4 this admission was 212 and not \non ARRT. Remains at risk of infection especially given he is \nundomiciled.\n[] Is discharged with 5 day course of doxycycline for his left \nlower extremity cellulitis. He should start this on ___ and \ncomplete on ___.\n[] He was found to have residual DVT as well as likely new \nsuperficial venous thromboembolism in his lower legs and \ndischarged on Eliquis 5mg BID x 3 months. He should be monitored \nto compete this course.\n\nOn release from prison, please offer him the following \nresources:\n___ for the Homeless\n___\nTel ___\n*\n___ Emergency Services Team (BEST)\n___\n*\n___\nPAATHS (Providing Access to Addictions Treatment, Hope and\nSupport)\n___\nWalk in hours:\n___, ___, ___ 7:30am- 3:30 pm\n___ 7:30 - 1 pm\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n==============\n# LLE wounds\n# LLE cellulitis\nHe presented with wounds on left leg both on posterior calf and \non lateral calf in ___ fasciotomy scar site. The wounds \nappeared warm and cellulitic but without drainage or abscess. \nPlain films showed soft tissue defect but no evidence of \nosteomyelitis or tracking soft tissue gas. In the ED he was \nstarted on ceftaz and vanc, however ID consulted and recommended \nnarrowing to CTX given prior wound cultures without growth and \nblood cx in ___ with group A strep. Orthopedics was consulted \nto assess the wounds and felt that there was no need for \nsurgical intervention. Wound care was consulted and his leg was \ndressed and wrapped. One blood culture grew GPCs. There was \nconcern this could have been contaminant, however given he was \nimmunocompromised and with IVDU history he was treated with \nvancomycin. When cultures resulted as coag negative staph, and \npositive in only one blood culture, it was thought this was most \nlikely contaminant. Wound culture grew MRSA and so he was \ntransitioned from vancomycin to PO doxy for non-purulent \ncellulitis with plan for 5 days of doxycycline (end date \n___.\n\n#AMS\nReceived hefty dose of ketamine and multiple doses of lorazepam \nin the ED and therefore required airway watch the ICU initially \nbut was able to protect his airway and sattting well on RA. He \nhad continuous oxygen monitoring on arrival to the floor. His \nAMS improved as Ativan left his system and he became alert and \noriented.\n\n# Elevated CK\nElevated to 650 on admission, although reassuringly with normal \nCr so less concerned for rhabdomyolysis induced renal damage \n(which he has had in the past in the setting of compartment \nsyndrome).

On discharge in ___ was written \nfor methadone 7.5mg, unclear if he has been taking but suspect \nnot (he reports taking it but at unclear dose/frequency). \nPsychiatry saw him and offered suboxone or naltrexone which he \ndeclined.\n\n#Opiate withdrawal\nLast use was unknown, he did not have opiates in his serum tox \nscreen on admission. He was monitored for signs/symptoms of \nwithdrawal but did not have any withdrawal symptoms on the \nfloor.\n\n#Alcohol withdrawal\nPresumed alcohol use, patient not able to further clarify use. \nStarted on thiamine and MVI this admission and monitored on CIWA \nbut did not score.\n\n#History of DVT\n#s/p IVC filter\nDiagnosed ___, very extensive. IVC filter placed ___. On re \nultrasound ___, DVT extended compared to prior. Decision made \nwith ___ to leave IVC filter in place, given concern for \nsuboptimal compliance. He was discharged after last admission \nwith 5mg Eliquis BID. However, on admission notes that he does \nnot take any medications. LENIS this admission revealed \nimproving left lower extremity clot burden and small possibly \nnew superficial right lowe rextremity clot so he was started on \nEliquis BID. ___ was consulted regarding IVC filter and given \npossibly new clot and poor adherence with anticoagulation \nrecommended leaving filter in place. Was discharged with IVC and \nanticoagulation with Eliquis 5mg BID for 3 months.\n\n#HIV\n#HCV\nNot on ARRT, and hep C has not been treated. His CD4 was 212 \nthis admission and his HIV viral load was 5.6.
