The right atrium is \nmildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an\natrial septal defect or right-to-left shunt on color Doppler or \nagitated saline at rest. The estimated right\natrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with a normal\ncavity size. There is normal regional and global left \nventricular systolic function. Quantitative biplane\nleft ventricular ejection fraction is 57 % (normal 54-73%). Left \nventricular cardiac index is normal\n(>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow \ntract gradient. Normal right ventricular\ncavity size with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular \nplane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal.\nThe aortic sinus is mildly dilated with a normal ascending aorta \ndiameter for gender. There is a normal\ndescending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are \nmildly thickened. There is no aortic valve\nstenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve \nleaflets appear structurally normal with no\nmitral valve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. \nThe pulmonic valve leaflets are normal.\nThe tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There \nis physiologic tricuspid regurgitation.\nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is \nno pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nnormal cavity size and regional/\nglobal biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral \nregurgitation with normal valve morphology.\nMild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mildly dilated \naortic sinus. No right-to-left shunt at\nrest. No prior study available for comparison.\n\nPelvic XR\nRight acetabular fracture extending into the posterior \nacetabulum and \nsupra-acetabular ilium, better seen on the prior CT is seen is \narea of \nsclerosis along the right supra-acetabular ilium and periosteal \nthickening \nalong the iliopectineal line on the current radiograph.  \nSubcortical cyst \nalong the right acetabulum, felt to be degenerative.  Minimal \ndegenerative \nchanges and labral calcifications on the left.  Superior \nendplate compression \ndeformity of L5 vertebral body, better assessed on the prior CT. \n Evaluation \nof sacrum is limited due to overlying bowel gas shadow.  Diffuse \n\ndemineralization., \n\nCTA Chest\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nHEART AND VASCULATURE: Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified \nto the \nsubsegmental level without filling defect to indicate a \npulmonary embolus. The \ndescending thoracic aorta is increased in caliber measuring up \nto 3.9 cm in \ndiameter (2; 48) with extensive amount of noncalcified plaque.  \nThere is an \nulcerated plaque in the distal descending thoracic aorta along \nthe lateral \nwall with mild bulging of the aorta at that level (301; 79).  \nThere is \nmoderate atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta.  There \nis mild \nprominence of the pulmonary arteries, with the right pulmonary \nartery \nmeasuring 2.9 cm.  There is no evidence of dissection or \nintramural hematoma.  \nThe heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within normal \nlimits.  Moderate \ncoronary artery calcifications are seen.  No pericardial \neffusion is seen. \n  \nAXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: No axillary, mediastinal, or \nhilar \nlymphadenopathy is present.  No mediastinal mass. \n  \nPLEURAL SPACES: There is a trace left pleural effusion and a \ntrace right \npleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. \n  \nLUNGS/AIRWAYS: There is moderate dependent bibasilar \natelectasis.  There is \nbilateral severe centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema most \nsevere in the \nupper lobes.  There is redemonstration of biapical \npleuroparenchymal opacity, \nlikely scarring given presence of calcifications.  There is a \nlarge 6.4 x 3.3 \ncm right apical bulla (601; 33).  3 mm pulmonary nodule in the \nright middle \nlobe is again demonstrated (2; 64).  There is redemonstration of \na triangular \nshaped 4 mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe (2; 49). \n  \nThere is mild bilateral bronchial wall thickening with small \namount of mucous \nplugging in the lower lobes (2; 89). \n  \nBASE OF NECK: Visualized thyroid appears unremarkable.  There is \nno \nsupraclavicular lymphadenopathy. \n  \nABDOMEN:  Included portion of the upper abdomen is demonstrates \nvicarious \nexcretion of contrast in the gallbladder.  There is thickening \nof the left \nadrenal gland without definite discrete nodule (2; 30).  A 5.4 \ncm cyst is \nnoted in the right upper pole.  A 2.1 cm cyst is also noted in \nthe right upper \npole. \n  \nBONES: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? \nRedemonstration of diffuse \nosteopenia with mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative changes \nof the \nthoracic spine.  There is redemonstration of a partially \nvisualized L1 \ncompression fracture, likely chronic. \n  \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \n  \n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality.  \nUlcerated plaque, \naortic arch.  Mildly dilated descending thoracic aorta. \n2. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia. \nWith such \nsevere emphysema, progressive demonstrable atelectasis at lung \nbases can \nproduce disproportionate respiratory insufficiency. \n3. Bilateral apical linear opacities with calcification may \nrepresent \nscarring.  However, unless prior CTs are available for \ncomparison to \ndemonstrate stability, a CT chest in 6 months is recommended. \n4. Stable pulmonary nodules in the right upper and middle lobe \nmeasuring up to \n4 mm, which can be reassessed either with comparison to prior CT \nor a CT chest \nin 6 months. \n5. Mild bilateral bronchial wall thickening with small amount \nmucous plugging \nin the lower lobes. \n6. Trace left pleural effusion, increased compared to prior. \n  \nRECOMMENDATION(S):   CT chest in 6 months. \nReferral to ___ aorta service. \n\nCT A/P\n1.  Complex right acetabular fracture with predominantly \ninvolving the \nanterior wall.  Associated small intramuscular hematomas of the \nright iliacus \nand right obturator internus muscles.
