No pneumothorax. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ female with history of dCHF, \nAfib (on Eliquis), HTN, HLD, and recently diagnosed small cell \nlung cancer (possibly metastatic, awaiting ovarian mass biopsy, \ns/p C1 carboplatin/etoposide), who presented with fever and \nneutropenia, treated with vanc/cefepime for PNA, later developed \nnonconvulsive status, who developed hypoxemic respiratory \nfailure requiring intubation and transferred to the FICU, later \nextubated but continued to be hypoxemic; code status changed to \nDNR/DNI, and expired on ___. \n\nACUTE ISSUES\n==============\n#Hypoxemic respiratory failure\n#Tachypnea\n#Concern for pneumonia\n#Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF with pulmonary edema on CXR\n#Bilateral pleural effusions\nChronic CO2 retention with chronic metabolic alkalosis with \nacute decompensation from volume overload, possibly with \nunderlying infection, heart failure, lung cancer. Likely poor \nsubstrate i/s/o lung cancer. Required emergent intubation on the \nfloor prior to transfer to ___, later extubated but still \nrequiring face tent or BiPAP. Received 7 days of abx tx and \nLasix gtt with minimal urine output given rising Cr. CXR showed \nbilateral pleural effusions which were drained by IP placement \nof R pigtail on ___ L on ___. Unfortunately, patient's \nhypoxemia did not improve. Her code status was changed to \nDNR/DNI after her family determined that she would not want \nadditional aggressive treatments. She expired on ___. \n\n#Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus\n#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\nPatient with mild confusion on ___ with progression of \nencephalopathy found to be somnolent and minimally responsive on \nmorning of ___. Labs were stable and head CT was negative. \nRepeat UA negative. EEG was applied and concerning \nnon-convulsive status epilepticus. She was given ativan 3mg IV x \n2 and started on keppra for the seizures. Unclear cause of \nseizures, differential includes infection (less likely), \nmetabolic alkalosis (although appears stable), medications \n(possibly cefepime), underlying metastases (none on recent brain \nMRI). Possibly complicating mental status is hypoxia, \nhypercarbia,  delirium, uremia with rising Cr and declining UOP. \nMental status waxing/waning, but overall slowly improving. Brain \nMRI w/ and w/o contrast showed some meningeal enhancement. \nParaneoplastic antibody panel negative. \nShe was continued on keppra, renally dosed per neurology. \n\n#ATN\nRising Cr, baseline Cr 0.6-0.8. ATN secondary to renal ischemia \nand possibly sepsis. Urine with muddy brown casts. She was \ntreated with Lasix gtt with diuril boluses (for her pulmonary \nedema); these were stopped per renal recommendations. Her Cr \ncontinued to rise with minimal urine output. Her family and HCP \ndecided that dialysis was not within her GOC. \n\n#Anemia\nThought to be secondary to chemotherapy. Fibrinogen/haptoglobin \nnot indicative of consumption. Her CBC was monitored.\n\n#Atrial Fibrillation\nCHADS2VASC 5+\nContinued IV heparin in setting of rising Cr. Heparin gtt was \nstopped on ___ to focus on comfort care.\n\n#Metabolic Alkalosis\nOverall stable for past month however unclear etiology. Thought \nto be component of diuresis, volume contraction, and possibly \nhypokalemia. She was given dose of acetazolamide on ___. \nConcern for possible ___ syndrome given metabolic \nalkalosis and hypokalemia possibly from ACTH-secreting tumor. \nHowever appears patient had recent prior work-up for ___ \nwith negative salivary cortisol and ACTH. Renal thinks may be \nrelated to starting torsemide (this was d/c'ed). \n\n#Nutrition\nShe received an OG tube; tube feeds were later discontinued to \nfocus on comfort. \n\n#History of Paraneoplastic Scleroderma vs. Palmar Fasciitis:\nNoted to have purple finger tips on last admit, seen by rheum.\n\n#Hypokalemia\n-Repleted as needed\n\n#Transaminitis: Overall stable.\n-Held home statin\n\n#Hypothyroidism\n-Continued synthroid IV\n\nOn ___, MD was called to bedside to exam ___ \n___.  She was\nDNR/DNI, comfort measures only after family discussion on the am\nof ___.  She had no pulse, no heart nor lung sounds on\nauscultation, no withdrawal from noxious stimuli.  Tiume of \ndeath\nwas 14:50. Cause of death was hypoxemic respiratory failure in\nthe setting of her small cell lung cancer. \n\nIn brief, she is a ___ woman with history of dCHF, Afib\n(on Eliquis), HTN, HLD, and recently diagnosed small cell lung\ncancer (possibly metastatic, awaiting ovarian mass biopsy, s/p \nC1\ncarboplatin/etoposide), who initially presented with fever and\nneutropenia, hospital course complicated by nonconvulsive status\nepilepticus, ___, hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring\nintubation, transferred to the FICU where her course was\ncomplicated by toxic metabolic encephalopathy, ongoing renal\nfailure, hypoxemia.\n\nBilateral chest tubes and PICC line were removed per family \nrequest. Autopsy was declined. Attending of record Dr. ___ was notified as was PCP ___.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. Apixaban 5 mg PO BID \n2. Atorvastatin 40 mg PO QPM \n3. Levothyroxine Sodium 100 mcg PO DAILY \n4. Metoprolol Succinate XL 75 mg PO BID \n5. Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY \n6. Torsemide 20 mg PO DAILY \n7.
