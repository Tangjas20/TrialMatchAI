Family notes progressively worsening \nmental status with decline in speech output, arousal, and \norientation over the past week and a half. Today, she was not \nconversing. Otherwise family denies any fevers, chills, nausea, \nvomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal \npain, urinary or bowel symptoms. \n\nPatient recently admitted on ___ for acute \nmetabolic encephalopathy and shock initially requiring 2 \npressors, intubated for airway protection and in the FICU until \n___. Started on ampicillin, acyclovir, vancomycin and cefepime \nempirically for infectious source including meningoencephalitis, \nhowever initial workup did not reveal infectious source. Of \nnote, LP not performed due to significant thrombocytopenia and \non anticoagulation. Also of note, pneumonia was identified later \nin hospital course, unclear if that was inciting event or if \ndeveloped in the setting of intubation. MRI showed known MS, EEG \nwithout epileptiform activity, thought she was started on \nempiric Keppra given there had been one event where she may have \nhad left eye deviation associated with posturing. Her ampicillin \nand acyclovir were discontinued given low suspicion for \nmeningoencephalitis, as was her vancomycin, and she completed a \ncourse of Zosyn. Shock was thought to be neurogenic secondary to \nautonomic dysfunction, with possible distributive component from \ninfectious process. She subsequently slowly improved to baseline\nmental status without clear etiology identified. \n\nIn the ED:  \n- Initial Vitals: \nT 95.5F oral, 89.0F rectal; HR 64, BP 119/62, RR 14, 97% on RA\n\n- Exam: \nAOx3, PERRL, ___ strength bilaterally in UE and ___, SLTIT, 2 cm \nsacral decubitus ulcer without signs of active infection\n\n- Labs:  \nWBC 8.7, Hgb 9.6 (baseline), Plt 64 (493 on prior discharge \n___\nBUN 33, Cr 0.7, Na 142, K 5.8 (whole blood 5.5, no peaked T \nwaves)\nLipase 57\nTrop < 0.01\nLactate 0.5\nSerum tox negative\nFlu negative\nUA with trace blood, 30 prot, pos nitrites, large ___, 3 RBC, \n>182 WBC, few bacteria\n\n- Imaging: \n-CXR: Slightly limited exam due to patient positioning. Low lung \nvolumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n-NCHCT: 1. No acute intracranial process. \n2. Chronic white matter hypodensities appear grossly similar, \nlikely related to patient's multiple sclerosis. \n3. Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells suggests \nongoing inflammation, as seen previously. \n\n- Consults: Neurology - overall favor toxic-metabolic etiology \nto mental status symptoms as with prior recent admissions. \nShould improvement not be noted in mental status with passive \nrewarming and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, consideration \nmay be given to cvEEG, although current presentation not \nsuggestive of seizures.\n\n- Interventions: 2g IV cefepime, 500mg IV flagyl\n\nOn arrival to the floor, patient awake and alert but minimally \nresponsive.

Found to have \npositive UA, sacral ulcer that probes to bone, and \nthrombocytopenia to 64, started on cefepime/flagyl and started \nactive rewarming with bear hugger and monitoring with rectal \nprobe in the ED.\n   \n#Hypothermia:\n#UTI:\n#Sacral ulcer, c/f osteomyelitis:\nFamily notes progressively worsening mental status with decline \nin speech output, arousal, and orientation over the past week \nand a half. Has had prior admissions with similar presentation, \nusually occurs in the setting of infection. In the ED, she was \nnoted to have hypothermia with rectal temp 89.0F (baseline temp \n___ per family) and positive UA with urine culture growing E. \nColi. Also noted to have sacral ulcer that probes to bone with \nsubsequent MRI sacrum noting no abscess but likely \nosteomyelitis. In terms of treatment, she was started active \nrewarming with bear hugger and 3-way foley placed for possible \nwarm bladder irrigation, she was normothermic soon after arrival \nto the the unit. Initially on cefepime/flagyl, switched to \nvanc/ceftriaxone for osteomyelitis and UTI. Surgery was \nconsulted and performed limited debridement of sacral ulcer. ID \nwas consulted as well. Aggressively fluid resuscitated with \ncrystalloids. TMP (home med for UTI prophylaxis) was held while \non broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotics were narrowed to \nceftriaxone after urine culture grew sensitive E coli.\nPer ID recommendations she underwent bone biopsy on ___ to \nfurther guide sacral ulcer treatment. This was intermediately \nresistant to ceftriaxone and zosyn, so meropenem was initiated & \nplanned for discharge. Bactrim ppx may be held during this time. \n\n\n# Altered mental status: likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy \nin the setting of infection as above.

We \nfound that your temperature was very low, likely due to a \nurinary tract infection. We treated your infection with \nantibiotics.\n\nYou also were found to have a worsening pressure ulcer. Due to \nconcern that the was ulcer had caused infection of the bone, you \nhad a biopsy of the bone. We waited to see what bacteria was \ngrowing and adjusted your antibiotics for the infection you \nhave. You shall continue to receive antibiotics as an infusion \nat home for the next few weeks ~6 weeks for now. A visiting \nnurse shall come and check in as well. Continue to keep the \nwound clean and avoid soiling from urine/fecal contents. \n\nKindly visit your primary care doctor within the next few weeks, \nwe shall also have you follow up with the infectious disease \ndoctor. We would also like you to see a surgeon and a plastic \nsurgeon to be able to coordinate procedures to allow better \nhealing of your wound. We would also like for you to see a \nurologist/ specialist for the urinary bladder to check if you \nhave any bladder problems that may be causing frequent \ninfections. \n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you, and we are happy that \nyou're feeling better!\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"
