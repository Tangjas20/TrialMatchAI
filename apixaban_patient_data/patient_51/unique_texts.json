  "15365753-DS-8": "MEDICINE Allergies: Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors Attending: . Chief Complaint: headache, hypertensive urgency Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: is a female with PMH of Afib on amiodarone/apixaban, Type B dissection, CKD, HTN, hypothyroidism, and gastritis, who presented with headache in the setting of hypertensive urgency. The patient was recently seen in clinic on for evaluation of headaches that had been intermittently present over the past several weeks located over her forehead and top of head, partially responsive to Tylenol. On that visit, her home HTN regimen was reviewed as well as her home BP recordings, which were in decent range of 130s/50s to 150s/60s. Her headaches were thought to be tension-type and she was instructed to increase the dose of Tylenol and try some caffeine to see if this would help. It was also postulated that her isosorbide may be related to her headaches. Reassuringly, the patient had a CT head on without concerning intracranial pathology. On the morning of admission, the patient's daughter took her blood pressure and noted SBP in the low 200s. She then had one episode of vomiting in the setting of a severe headache. Due to these symptoms, she was brought to the ED for further evaluation. In the emergency department, she was noted to be hypertensive again with systolic BP of 200 that resolved to 170 without intervention. She was subsequently given her home medications with further improvement of her blood pressure to within normal range. CT head without bleed or other concerning findings. She was admitted to medicine for further management of hypertensive urgency. Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was interviewed with assistance of daughter present at bedside. The patient reports she is feeling 100% better with complete resolution of her HA. She further denies any other red flag symptoms including change in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower extremity swelling. She additionally denies any symptoms concerning for GCA including no scalp tenderness, jaw fatigue with chewing, or any shoulder/hip soreness or weakness suggestive of PMR. Her daughter notes that aside from the day of admission, her home blood pressures have otherwise been in good range and she at times haves HAs while normotensive, albeit none quite as severe. ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI. All other systems were reviewed and are negative.

Streak artifact limits evaluation of pons and midbrain. 2. No acute intracranial abnormality, no definite evidence of acutehemorrhage. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the detectionof acute infarct. 3. Atrophy, probable small vessel ischemic changes, and atherosclerotic vascular disease as described. 4. Minimal paranasal sinus disease , as described. Brief Hospital Course: with PMH of Afib on amiodarone/apixaban, Type B dissection, CKD, HTN, hypothyroidism, and gastritis, who presented with headache in the setting of hypertensive urgency. Fortunately, her BPs are now well controlled after receiving her home regimen and her headache has completely resolved. # Headache: # Hypertensive Urgency: Patient with acute on chronic severe headache with vomiting x1 in setting of systolic BP > 200. No concern for hypertensive emergency given no AMS or focal neurologic changes, chest pain or ECG changes, , or signs/symptoms of CHF exacerbation. CT head without bleed or mass. Though patient with known type B dissection, repeat CTA chest not pursued as BP equal in both arms and patient without chest pain symptoms. Headache fully resolved with correction of BP to normal range. Patient also with history of HAs while normotensive, thus suspect that she is also experiencing tension-type HAs that may be unrelated. There is low concern for GCA given absence of scalp tenderness, vision change, jaw claudication, or PMR symptoms. Unclear why the patient became so abruptly hypertensive in setting of otherwise fairly decent control as she and her daughter report full compliance. Potential secondary causes of severe HTN can be explored at discretion of PCP, but does not require inpatient admission at this time. BP 120s/60s at time of discharge. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # Atrial fibrillation: Continued amiodarone and apixiban 2.5mg BID # HFpEF: No evidence of acute exacerbation. Continued torsemide and home BP regimen of carvedilol, losartan, amlodipine, and isosorbide. # Type B Aortic dissection: BP symmetric in both arms. No symptoms to raise concern for progression. # CKD: Baseline Cr reported to be ~1.6. Currently 1.3 on discharge. # Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 25mcg qOD TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] work up for secondary causes of hypertension per PCP . > 30 mins spent coordinating discharge Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.
