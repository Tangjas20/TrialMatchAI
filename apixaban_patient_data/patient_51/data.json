On that visit, her home HTN \nregimen was reviewed as well as her home BP recordings, which \nwere in decent range of 130s/50s to 150s/60s. Her headaches were \nthought to be tension-type and she was instructed to increase \nthe dose of Tylenol and try some caffeine to see if this would \nhelp. It was also postulated that her isosorbide may be related \nto her headaches. Reassuringly, the patient had a CT head on \n___ without concerning intracranial pathology. \n\nOn the morning of admission, the patient's daughter took her \nblood pressure and noted SBP in the low 200s. She then had one \nepisode of vomiting in the setting of a severe headache. Due to \nthese symptoms, she was brought to the ED for further \nevaluation. \n\nIn the emergency department, she was noted to be hypertensive \nagain with systolic BP of 200 that resolved to 170 without \nintervention. She was subsequently given her home medications \nwith further improvement of her blood pressure to within normal \nrange. CT head without bleed or other concerning findings. She \nwas admitted to medicine for further management of hypertensive \nurgency. \n\nUpon arrival to the floor, the patient was interviewed with \nassistance of daughter present at bedside. The patient reports \nshe is feeling 100% better with complete resolution of her HA. \nShe further denies any other red flag symptoms including change \nin vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower extremity \nswelling. She additionally denies any symptoms concerning for \nGCA including no scalp tenderness, jaw fatigue with chewing, or \nany shoulder/hip soreness or weakness suggestive of PMR. Her \ndaughter notes that aside from the day of admission, her home \nblood pressures have otherwise been in good range and she at \ntimes haves HAs while normotensive, albeit none quite as severe. \n\n\nROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI. All \nother systems were reviewed and are negative. \n \nPast Medical History:\nAortic dissection complicated by bradycardic arrests x2 \n(admission of ___\nUpper GI bleed ___ gastric ulcer (admission of ___\nHTN \nHLD\nCAD s/p NSTEMI ___\nHepatic steatosis\nCarotid stenosis\nOsteoporosis\nCKD\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nBrother, ___, RENAL CANCER                            \nBrother, ___, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION                         \n\nBrother, ___, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n\n \nPhysical Exam:\n___ ___ Temp: 97.7 PO BP: 151/58 HR: 62 RR: 20 O2 sat: 98%\nO2 delivery: RA \nGENERAL: pleasant older, mostly ___ speaking woman, alert \nand\nin no apparent distress. \nEYES: Anicteric, pupils equally round\nENT: Ears and nose without visible erythema, masses, or trauma. \nOropharynx without visible lesion, erythema or exudate\nCV: Heart regular, no murmur, no S3, no S4.

Fortunately, \nher BPs are now well controlled after receiving her home regimen \nand her headache has completely resolved. \n\n# Headache: \n# Hypertensive Urgency: \nPatient with acute on chronic severe headache with vomiting x1 \nin setting of systolic BP > 200. No concern for hypertensive \nemergency given no AMS or focal neurologic changes, chest pain \nor ECG changes, ___, or signs/symptoms of CHF \nexacerbation. CT head without bleed or mass. Though patient with \nknown type B dissection, repeat CTA chest not pursued as BP \nequal in both arms and patient without chest pain symptoms. \nHeadache fully resolved with correction of BP to normal range. \nPatient also with history of HAs while normotensive, thus \nsuspect that she is also experiencing tension-type HAs that may \nbe unrelated. There is low concern for GCA given absence of \nscalp tenderness, vision change, jaw claudication, or PMR \nsymptoms. Unclear why the patient became so abruptly \nhypertensive in setting of otherwise fairly decent control as \nshe and her daughter report full compliance. Potential secondary \ncauses of severe HTN can be explored at discretion of PCP, but \ndoes not require inpatient admission at this time. BP 120s/60s \nat time of discharge. \n\nCHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: Continued amiodarone and apixiban 2.5mg \nBID \n\n# HFpEF: No evidence of acute exacerbation. Continued torsemide \nand home BP regimen of carvedilol, losartan, amlodipine, and \nisosorbide. \n\n# Type B Aortic dissection: BP symmetric in both arms. No \nsymptoms to raise concern for progression. \n\n# CKD: Baseline Cr reported to be ~1.6. Currently 1.3 on \ndischarge.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 25mcg qOD\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[] work up for secondary causes of hypertension per PCP \n___. \n\n> 30 mins spent coordinating discharge\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
