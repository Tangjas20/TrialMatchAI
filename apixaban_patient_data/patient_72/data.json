There is mild \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a\nsmall cavity. There is normal regional and global left \nventricular systolic function. The visually estimated\nleft ventricular ejection fraction is 70%. There is no resting \nleft ventricular outflow tract gradient. Tissue\nDoppler suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure \n(PCWP greater than 18 mmHg). There is Grade I\ndiastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is \nhypertrophied. Moderately dilated right ventricular\ncavity with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane \nsystolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal. Intrinsic\nright ventricular systolic function is likely lower due to the \nseverity of tricuspid regurgitation. The aortic sinus\ndiameter is normal for gender with a normal ascending aorta \ndiameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is\nnormal with a normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) are moderately thickened.\nThere is minimal aortic valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] \naortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial \nmitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets\nare normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally \nnormal. There is moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid\nregurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. In the setting of at least moderate to\nsevere tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary artery systolic \npressure may be UNDERestimated. There is no\npericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: small, thick-walled, stiff left ventricle; \nmoderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension;\nmoderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation; dilated, \nthick-walled right ventricle\n\nMICROBIOLOGY\n============\nNone relevant.\n\nDISCHARGE LABS\n================ \n___ 06:42AM BLOOD WBC-5.6 RBC-3.83* Hgb-12.1 Hct-38.3 \nMCV-100* MCH-31.6 MCHC-31.6* RDW-14.6 RDWSD-53.5* Plt ___\n___ 06:42AM BLOOD Glucose-211* UreaN-35* Creat-0.9 Na-141 \nK-3.8 Cl-100 HCO3-27 AnGap-14\n___ 06:42AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-4.1 Mg-2.1\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSUMMARY\n==========\n___ with a history of left cerebellar stroke, Afib, HTN, HLD, \nDMII, sick sinus syndrome with PPM, and HFpEF, who presented \nwith generalized weakness, abdominal distention, and weight gain \nconsistent with a HF exacerbation. The patient was diuresed with \nIV Lasix and then transitioned to oral torsemide when euvolemic.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n======================\n[] Patient noted to be persistently hypertensive during this \nadmission. BP medications were adjusted, please continue to \nmonitor and uptitrate as needed.\n[] Consider dedicated sleep study to work up OSA given nocturnal \nhypoxia and refractory morning hypertension.\n[] Warfarin was discontinued and the patient was started on \napixaban for anticoagulation in the setting of atrial \nfibrillation with CHADSVASC 9.\n[] Consider discontinuing risperidone (patient taking for mild \ncognitive impairment) given that it can contribute to the \npatient's fatigue.\n[] The patient was noted to be intermittently mildly hypoxic \novernight while sleeping. It was suspected that she had \nundiagnosed OSA vs obesity hypoventilation syndrome vs \nprogressive pHTN (see below). The patient was discharged with \nhome O2.\n\nDISCHARGE WEIGHT: 66.1 kg\nDISCHARGE Cr: 0.9\nDISCHARGE DIURETIC: furosemide 60mg PO\n\n#CODE: Full\n#CONTACT: ___, ___\n\nACUTE ISSUES\n=============\n# Generalized weakness\n# HFpEF exacerbation\nThe patient presented with symptoms of generalized weakness over \nthe pastdays to weeks, coinciding with apprx 10lb weight gain, \ndespite increase in diuretic regimen as an outpatient. On \ninitial exam, she showed signs of volume overload with abdominal \ndistention and elevated JVP. Per review of records, there was \nnumerous documentation regarding weight gain, and instructions \nto increase Lasix dose. The patient denied dietary indiscretion \nor medication non adherence. Her last TTE in ___ showed mild \nLVH, EF >65%, grade II LV diastolic dysfunction. A repeat TTE \nshowed stiff LV, moderate to severe pHTN, and moderate to severe \nTR. The patient was continued on her home carvedilol throughout \nadmission. She was diuresed with 40mg IV Lasix until euvolemic \nand near a presumed dry weight of ~150 lbs. She was then \ntransitioned to 40mg PO torsemide however felt subjectively \nworse, concerning for overdiuresis. Cardiology was consulted for \nassistance with diuretic management and for possible further \nwork up given the findings on her TTE, and felt that the patient \nhad progressed appropriately on diuresis and was at her dry \nweight. The patient was subsequently discharged on ___ on \nfurosemide 60mg PO.\n\n# HTN\nBPs were persistently elevated throughout admission even after \nsuccessful diuresis. She was continued on home max doses of \namlopdipine and lisinopril. Imdur was switched to QHS dosing to \nhelp with AM hypertension. She was also started on \nspironolactone for improved BP control.\n\n# Hypoxia\nNoted to be intermittently hypoxic, primarily overnight while \nsleeping, despite improvement in volume status. Concerning for \nOSA vs obesity hypoventilation syndrome vs worsening pHTN given \nthe findings on echo, despite the patient being euvolemic. The \npatient was discharged on home O2.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Paroxysmal Afib\n___ score = 9. The patient was continued on home \ncarvedilol. She was initially continued on warfarin, but after \ndiscussions with the patient who indicated that she had planned \nto transition to a DOAC already, she was started on apixaban 5mg \nBID.\n\n# DMII c/b retinopathy and neuropathy\nLast HbA1c of 6.9% on ___. UA with signs of proteinuria. Home\nregimen of Glargine 16U (recently decreased from 20U) at \nbreakfast as well as ISS. On ACE-I for renal protection. The \npatient was continued on dose reduced lantus as well as ISS.\n\n# CVA, cerebellar\n# PVD s/p Left SFA stent procedure ___\n# HLD\nShe was continued on home pravastatin and aspirin.\n\n# Asthma\nThe patient was continued on home albuterol inhaler as needed.\n\n# Bradyarrhythmia (SSS), s/p dual chamber ___ (___)\nDural PPM placed in ___ after episodes of syncope were found to \nbe due to sick sinus syndrome. EKG on admission showed atrial \nand ventricular pacing. PPM recently interrogated during \nhospitalization in ___, no evidence of malfunctioning.\n\n# Generalized anxiety disorder\n# Mild cognitive impairment\nNo evidence of acute behavioral or neurocognitive changes. She \nwas continued on home Risperidone 0.25 mg and Memantine 5 mg.\n\n# GERD\nShe was continued on home PPI.\n\nGreater than ___ hour spent on care on day of discharge. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Your weight had progressively increased recently due \nto extra fluid retention.\n\nWhile you were here you were given IV Lasix to help you urinate \noff the extra fluid. You were then started on a new pill to help \nyou keep the fluid off when you go home. Instead of warfarin you \nwere started on a new blood thinner that does not require any \nlab monitoring. Your blood pressure medications were also \nadjusted.\n\nWhen you go home you should weigh yourself every morning, call \nMD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. You should also follow up \nwith outpatient your doctors as listed below. Please take all \nyour medications as prescribed.\n\nWe wish you the best!\n\nYour ___ Care Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",
