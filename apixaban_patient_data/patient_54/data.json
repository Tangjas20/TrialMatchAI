Mild interstitial edema. \n  \nEvidence of prior cardiac surgery.  Prosthetic aortic valve in \nplace. \n  \nAnasarca. \n  \nRight-sided pacemaker. \n\nCT A/P\n  \n1. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic pathology. \n2. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis. \n3. Re-demonstration of a mildly nodular liver suggestive of \ncardiac \nhepatopathy or cardiac cirrhosis in the setting of fluid \noverload. \n4. Small volume ascites. \n5. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. \n6. Please refer to dedicated CT chest performed on same day for \ndescription of \nintrathoracic findings. \n\nTTE\nThe left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. No \nthrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium\n(best excluded by TEE). The right atrium is mildly enlarged. \nThere is a possible atrial septal defect. There is\nmild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a borderline \nincreased/dilated cavity. There is suboptimal\nimage quality to assess regional left ventricular function. \nOverall left ventricular systolic function is severely\ndepressed. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection \nfraction is ___. Left ventricular cardiac\nindex is low normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left \nventricular outflow tract gradient. Diastolic\nfunction could not be assessed. Normal right ventricular cavity \nsize with depressed free wall motion. Intrinsic\nright ventricular systolic function is likely lower due to the \nseverity of tricuspid regurgitation. There is\nabnormal interventricular septal motion c/w right ventricular \npressure and volume overload. The aortic sinus\ndiameter is normal for gender with mildly dilated ascending \naorta. A ___ aortic valve bioprosthesis is\npresent. The prosthesis is well seated with leaflets not well \nseen but normal gradient. No mass/vegetation\nseen, but cannot fully exclude due to suboptimal image quality. \nThere is a paravalvular jet of mild [1+] aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened \nwith no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or\nvegetations are seen on the mitral valve. There is moderate [2+] \nmitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve\nleaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear \nstructurally normal. No mass/vegetation seen, but\ncannot exclude due to suboptimal image quality. There is SEVERE \n[4+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic\nshadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be \nUNDERestimated. There is SEVERE pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. In the setting of at least moderate to \nsevere tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary\nartery systolic pressure may be UNDERestimated. There is no \npericardial effusion. A left pleural effusion is\npresent.\nCompared with the prior TTE (images not available for review) of \n___ , the estimated pulmonary\nartery systolic pressure is now increased. There is evidence of \nRV pressure/volume overload. Regional function\ncannot be fully assessed due to suboptimal image quality.\n\nNCHCT\n1. New small late acute/subacute right frontal lobe infarct. \n2. No midline shift or intracranial hemorrhage. \n3. Probably chronic right temporal lobe subcortical white matter \ninfarct. \n\nMRI BRAIN ___\n No evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage or intracranial \nmass.\n2. Minimal white matter changes in the cerebral hemispheres \nbilaterally,\nnonspecific but suggestive of chronic microangiopathy.  Probable \nsmall old\ninfarct in the right anterior frontal lobe.\n3. Intermittent visualization of the distal cervical left \nvertebral artery and\nits proximal intradural portion, possibly artifactual due to \nslow flow. \nUnremarkable remainder of the intradural left V4 segment.\n4. Otherwise patent intracranial vasculature without evidence of \nhigh-grade\nstenosis, vessel occlusion or aneurysm formation.\n \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nHOSPITAL COURSE\n==================\n\nMr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of HFrEF (EF 25% \n___, afib on apixaban, severe AS s/p TAVR, complete heart \nblock s/p dual lead AICD, CKD, DM, and PVD s/p left SFA to DP \nbypass graft who presented with rectal bleeding secondary to a \nDieulafoy lesion that resolved with clip. Patient had a \nprolonged complex hospital course notable for bleeding from his \nDP bypass site on ___ requiring transfer to vascular surgery \nand Ligation of L SFA-DP bypass on ___ and eventual BKA on \n___. Patient subsequently developed hypervolemia secondary to \ndecompensated HFrEF, for which he received aggressive diuresis \non the medicine service complicated by ___ secondary to ATN \nexacerbated by CIN. Unfortunately, patient renal function \ncontinued to worsen over the course of the final week of his \nhospitalization and his hypervolemia was refractory to maximal \nmedical diuretic therapy and he developed worsening uremia and \ninitial signs of electrolyte derangements. Of note, patient was \nalso noted to have coagulopathy as well as thrombocytopenia on \nlaboratory studies with nodular fibrotic liver on imaging all \nconsistent with likely cardiogenic cirrhosis.\n\nIn the setting of these multiple medical issues, patient mental \nstatus declined sharply even requiring MICU transfer on ___ for \nsevere encephalopathy and concern for respiratory status. This \nencephalopathy was likely multifactorial in the setting of \nrising uremia, nutritional deficiency from prolonged hospital \ncourse, hepatic encephalopathy, and hospital acquired delirium. \nIn spite of maximal medical therapy with vitamin repletion, \nlactulose, and delirium precautions, patient mental status \ncontinued to deteriorate until he was entirely unable to engage \nwith his surroundings. \n\nA family meeting was held on ___ with patient's adult children \nincluding his healthcare proxy and son, ___. During this \nmeeting it was explained that the patient was highly unlikely to \nexperience meaningful recovery in either mental status or renal \nfunction and his overall prognosis in the setting of multiorgan \nfailure (cardiac, renal, hepatic) was poor. The patient had a \nclear expressed wish to move forward with renal replacement \ntherapy as well as to limit medical interventions that would not \nrestore his independent quality of life and, therefore it was \ndecided to transition patient to CMO on ___. Patient expired on \n___ in no apparent distress.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain/headache \n2.
