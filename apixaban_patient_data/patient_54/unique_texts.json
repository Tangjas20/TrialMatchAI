Mild interstitial edema. Evidence of prior cardiac surgery. Prosthetic aortic valve in place. Anasarca. Right-sided pacemaker. CT A/P 1. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic pathology. 2. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis. 3. Re-demonstration of a mildly nodular liver suggestive of cardiac hepatopathy or cardiac cirrhosis in the setting of fluid overload. 4. Small volume ascites. 5. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. 6. Please refer to dedicated CT chest performed on same day for description of intrathoracic findings. TTE The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium (best excluded by TEE). The right atrium is mildly enlarged. There is a possible atrial septal defect. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a borderline increased/dilated cavity. There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional left ventricular function. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is . Left ventricular cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Diastolic function could not be assessed. Normal right ventricular cavity size with depressed free wall motion. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely lower due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. There is abnormal interventricular septal motion c/w right ventricular pressure and volume overload. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with mildly dilated ascending aorta. A aortic valve bioprosthesis is present. The prosthesis is well seated with leaflets not well seen but normal gradient. No mass/vegetation seen, but cannot fully exclude due to suboptimal image quality. There is a paravalvular jet of mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. There is moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/vegetation seen, but cannot exclude due to suboptimal image quality. There is SEVERE [4+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. There is SEVERE pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be UNDERestimated. There is no pericardial effusion. A left pleural effusion is present. Compared with the prior TTE (images not available for review) of , the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now increased. There is evidence of RV pressure/volume overload. Regional function cannot be fully assessed due to suboptimal image quality. NCHCT 1. New small late acute/subacute right frontal lobe infarct. 2. No midline shift or intracranial hemorrhage. 3. Probably chronic right temporal lobe subcortical white matter infarct. MRI BRAIN No evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage or intracranial mass. 2. Minimal white matter changes in the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, nonspecific but suggestive of chronic microangiopathy. Probable small old infarct in the right anterior frontal lobe. 3. Intermittent visualization of the distal cervical left vertebral artery and its proximal intradural portion, possibly artifactual due to slow flow. Unremarkable remainder of the intradural left V4 segment. 4. Otherwise patent intracranial vasculature without evidence of high-grade stenosis, vessel occlusion or aneurysm formation. Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE Mr. is a y/o male with a history of HFrEF (EF 25% , afib on apixaban, severe AS s/p TAVR, complete heart block s/p dual lead AICD, CKD, DM, and PVD s/p left SFA to DP bypass graft who presented with rectal bleeding secondary to a Dieulafoy lesion that resolved with clip. Patient had a prolonged complex hospital course notable for bleeding from his DP bypass site on requiring transfer to vascular surgery and Ligation of L SFA-DP bypass on and eventual BKA on . Patient subsequently developed hypervolemia secondary to decompensated HFrEF, for which he received aggressive diuresis on the medicine service complicated by secondary to ATN exacerbated by CIN. Unfortunately, patient renal function continued to worsen over the course of the final week of his hospitalization and his hypervolemia was refractory to maximal medical diuretic therapy and he developed worsening uremia and initial signs of electrolyte derangements. Of note, patient was also noted to have coagulopathy as well as thrombocytopenia on laboratory studies with nodular fibrotic liver on imaging all consistent with likely cardiogenic cirrhosis. In the setting of these multiple medical issues, patient mental status declined sharply even requiring MICU transfer on for severe encephalopathy and concern for respiratory status. This encephalopathy was likely multifactorial in the setting of rising uremia, nutritional deficiency from prolonged hospital course, hepatic encephalopathy, and hospital acquired delirium. In spite of maximal medical therapy with vitamin repletion, lactulose, and delirium precautions, patient mental status continued to deteriorate until he was entirely unable to engage with his surroundings. A family meeting was held on with patient's adult children including his healthcare proxy and son, . During this meeting it was explained that the patient was highly unlikely to experience meaningful recovery in either mental status or renal function and his overall prognosis in the setting of multiorgan failure (cardiac, renal, hepatic) was poor. The patient had a clear expressed wish to move forward with renal replacement therapy as well as to limit medical interventions that would not restore his independent quality of life and, therefore it was decided to transition patient to CMO on . Patient expired on in no apparent distress. Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain/headache 2.
