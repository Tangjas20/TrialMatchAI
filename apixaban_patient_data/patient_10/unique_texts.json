He was being treated for UTI in the setting of having an obstructed foley. A CT head was obtained showing an IPH and he was subsequently here to the . Neurosurgery was consulted, and a repeat CT head showed no interval change in size of IPH. A CT A/P was also obtained showing a R rib 9 fx. Per report, a CT C-spine was also obtained at that showed no acute fx. Transfer to Medicine Mr. is a year old man with hypertension, BPH with chronic urinary retention w/ h/o UTIs (chronic foley at nursing home), pacemaker for SSS, on eliquis for afib and PE year prior, who presented as OSH transfer from after he presented there after a fall from his bed. He subsequently c/o right hip pain and was brought to the where a CT head showed small left temporal-parietal hemorrhage thought to be traumatic in nature. A CT A/P showed a R rib 9 fx. CT C-spine showed no acute fx per report. Patient was then transferred to for neurosurgical evaluation. A repeat CT was stable. There was no indication for acute surgical intervention. The patient reportedly remained at his neurological baseline throughout. On the morning of , the patient acutely decompensated in mental status, reportedly more somnolent. Stat head CT demonstrated no significant interval change in IPH. Neurology consulted for AMS. At the time of transfer the patient reports he is doing Ok and denies any pain. He was somnolent and unable to open his eyes. Per records in the chart the patient was treated with ampicillin at the nursing home from for UTI.

IMAGING CXR No acute cardiopulmonary findings such as pneumothorax. No grossly displaced rib fractures were identified on this limited frontal radiograph. Pelvic XR Bilateral total hip arthroplasty, without evidence of perihardware complications such as loosening or fracture. Paget's disease of the pelvis again noted. CT head Small focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe cortex unchanged since prior study. No new hemorrhage. CT A/P 1. Acute right ninth rib fracture. 2. Unchanged minimally complex small left pleural effusion. 3. No evidence of solid organ injury. No pneumoperitoneum or definite free fluid within the abdomen. 4. Bilateral perinephric stranding and second bladder wall likely related to history of chronic outlet obstruction. CT head 1. Stable left temporal lobe hyperdensity, similar to prior exam without evidence of surrounding edema or significant mass effect. There is no evidence of new large vascular territory infarction, or new areas of hemorrhage. EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because of mild generalized background slowing, with activity predominantly in the theta range reaching a maximum of 6 hz. This indicates a mild encephalopathy, which is nonspecific in etiology. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures seen. Compared to the day prior study, there are no significant changes. Shoulder Xray No acute osseous abnormality identified. Small mineralized density projects adjacent to the left humeral head, likely reflective of calcific tendinopathy. Head CT 1. Stable small hyperdensity in the left posterior temporal lobe without significant edema. 2. No evidence for new intracranial abnormalities. Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE with h/o dementia, HTN, BPH with chronic Foley, SSS s/p pacemaker, A-fib on Eliquis who presented s/p fall, found to have new small and stable IPH with no surgical intervention indicated and repeat CT Head was stable. Hospital course complicated by UTI and altered mental status, s/p 10 day course of CTX, cefpodoxime. Mental status improved to baseline A&O secondary to underlying dementia. During hospitalization, he also has had several periods of unresponsiveness lasting up to several hours, where he would only withdraw to painful stimuli. His neice/HCP reported that he has had these for many years with extensive work-up unrevealing. He had a CT Head which showed no progression of the ICH. Neuro was consulted and EEG was done with no signs of seizure activity. These periods were felt to be psychiatric in nature. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: MEDICATIONS: New Meds: Labetalol 100 BID, Ramelteon 8 mg PO QHS Stopped Meds: Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO DAILY Changed Meds: None FOLLOW-UP Follow up: PCP, required after discharge: None Incidental findings: None OTHER ISSUES: ***Patient has episodes of unresponsiveness (only withdraws to pain). He usually comes back to being responsive in a couple of hours with no specific intervention. He needs to be reorientated and placed on delirium precautions, which help his mental status greatly.*** Avoid using antipsychotics in this patient if he become agitated since his BP will drop. He does well with redirection HTN: If BPs continues to be high, consider titrating labetalol. He was discharged on 100 BID; Goal SBP 120-150 Patient has acute right ninth rib fracture Chronic foley in place, continue management per protocol # CONTACT: # CODE: DNR/DNI (confirmed with HCP) ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # Delirium Etiology of delirium most likely due to UTI in this patient who has poor baseline cognitive reserve. EEG was done for concern for seizure but did not show any epileptiform discharges or seizures. He also has increased somnolence during his first few days of this hospotalization that may be due to repeated administrations of IV antipsychotic medication. TSH, B12 WNL. No signs of cirrhosis. Triggered on for AMS. Mental status improved in a couple of hours with no specific intervention. Per HCP he had similar events of unresponsiveness in the past which self resolved in a few hours usually, and he also had extensive workup for seizures. Workup for AMS on included head CT which was negative showing stable IPH, EKG normal, UCx and BCx were resent. UCx showed mixed flora iso of no fever/leukocytosis. BCx were negative. Patient was continued on mg PO DAILY during this admission. # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage Etiology initially thought to be due to trauma but it's unclear if this is feasible given that the IPH is deep and there is no obvious trauma seen on the patient's head. The thought is that the IPH occurred and subsequently had a fall because of it. Due to the location and small size of the hemorrhage it is possible it is a bleed in a vessel with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. No neurosurgical intervention was recommended. Anticoagulation was initially held iso of bleeding, but after a repeat head CT scan which showed no change in IPH size apixaban was restarted, as well as Aspirin. # Urinary tract infection: although patient has a urine culture that shows fecal contamination, given his altered mental status and white count that is improving with antibiotics, he was empirically treated for UTI with a 10 day course of cefpodozime 100 Q12. Repeat urine culture on showed again mixed flora, however patient was asymptomatic with no white count, fever or urinary symptoms. # Atrial fibrillation On Eliquis and Aspirin at home which was held temporarily due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Both were restarted by the time of discharge. # Hypertension Initially patient was receiving metoprolol, however BPs were running high so metoprolol was switched to labetalol 100 BID and BPs lowered around 120-130s systolic. If pressure continue to be high, labetalol can be uptitrated. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # BPH with chronic urinary retention patient with chronic foley # Sick sinus syndrome patient with pacemaker # Depression Patient continued on Sertraline 50 mg PO DAILY >30 minutes was spent on discharge planning and coordination Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 2. Divalproex (DELayed Release) 125 mg PO DAILY 3. Docusate Sodium 125 mg PO DAILY 4. Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID 5. Metoprolol Succinate XL 200 mg PO DAILY 6. Senna 8.6 mg PO DAILY 7. Timolol Maleate 0.5% 1 DROP BOTH EYES BID 8. Sertraline 50 mg PO DAILY Discharge Medications: 1. Labetalol 100 mg PO BID 2. Ramelteon 8 mg PO QHS 3. Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID 4. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 5. Divalproex (DELayed Release) 125 mg PO DAILY 6. Docusate Sodium 125 mg PO DAILY 7. Senna 8.6 mg PO DAILY 8. Sertraline 50 mg PO DAILY 9.
