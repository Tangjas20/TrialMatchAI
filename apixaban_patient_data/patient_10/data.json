No new hemorrhage.\n\nCT A/P ___\n1. Acute right ninth rib fracture.\n2. Unchanged minimally complex small left pleural effusion.\n3. No evidence of solid organ injury.  No pneumoperitoneum or \ndefinite free fluid within the abdomen.\n4. Bilateral perinephric stranding and second bladder wall \nlikely related to history of chronic outlet obstruction.\n\nCT head ___\n1. Stable left temporal lobe hyperdensity, similar to prior exam \nwithout evidence of surrounding edema or significant mass \neffect.  There is no evidence of new large vascular territory \ninfarction, or new areas of hemorrhage.\n\nEEG ___\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring \nstudy because\nof mild generalized background slowing, with activity \npredominantly in the\ntheta range reaching a maximum of 6 hz. This indicates a mild \nencephalopathy, which is nonspecific in etiology. There are no \nepileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures seen. \nCompared to the day prior study, there are no significant \nchanges.\n\nShoulder Xray ___\nNo acute osseous abnormality identified.  Small mineralized \ndensity projects adjacent to the left humeral head, likely \nreflective of calcific tendinopathy.\n\nHead CT ___\n1.

No evidence for new intracranial abnormalities.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE\n=====================\n___ with h/o dementia, HTN, BPH with chronic Foley, SSS s/p \npacemaker, A-fib on Eliquis who presented s/p fall, found to \nhave new small and stable IPH with no surgical intervention \nindicated and repeat CT Head was stable. Hospital course \ncomplicated by UTI and altered mental status, s/p 10 day course \nof CTX, cefpodoxime. Mental status improved to baseline A&O ___ \nsecondary to underlying dementia. During hospitalization, he \nalso has had several periods of unresponsiveness lasting up to \nseveral hours, where he would only withdraw to painful stimuli. \nHis neice/HCP reported that he has had these for many years with \nextensive work-up unrevealing. He had a CT Head which showed no \nprogression of the ICH. Neuro was consulted and EEG was done \nwith no signs of seizure activity. These periods were felt to be \npsychiatric in nature. \n\n=======================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=======================\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n- New Meds: Labetalol 100 BID, Ramelteon 8 mg PO QHS \n- Stopped Meds: Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO DAILY  \n- Changed Meds: None\n\nFOLLOW-UP \n- Follow up: PCP, ___\n- ___ required after discharge: None\n- Incidental findings: None\n\nOTHER ISSUES:\n***Patient has episodes of unresponsiveness (only withdraws to \npain). He usually comes back to being responsive in a couple of \nhours with no specific intervention. He needs to be reorientated \nand placed on delirium precautions, which help his mental status \ngreatly.***\n- Avoid using antipsychotics in this patient if he become \nagitated since his BP will drop. He does well with redirection\n- HTN: If BPs continues to be high, consider titrating \nlabetalol. He was discharged on 100 BID; Goal SBP 120-150\n- Patient has acute right ninth rib fracture \n- Chronic foley in place, continue management per protocol\n\n# CONTACT: ___ ___\n# CODE: DNR/DNI (confirmed with HCP)\n\n=====================================\n\nACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:\n\n# Delirium - Etiology of delirium most likely due to UTI in this \npatient who has poor baseline cognitive reserve. EEG was done \nfor concern for seizure but did not show any epileptiform \ndischarges or seizures. He also has increased somnolence during \nhis first few days of this hospotalization that may be due to \nrepeated administrations of IV antipsychotic medication. TSH, \nB12 WNL. No signs of cirrhosis. Triggered on ___ for AMS. Mental \nstatus improved in a couple of hours with no specific \nintervention. Per HCP he had similar events of unresponsiveness \nin the past which self resolved in a few hours usually, and he \nalso had extensive workup for seizures. Workup for AMS on ___ \nincluded head CT which was negative showing stable IPH, EKG - \nnormal, UCx and BCx were resent. UCx showed mixed flora iso of \nno fever/leukocytosis. BCx were negative. Patient was continued \non ___ mg PO DAILY during this admission.\n\n# Intraparenchymal hemorrhage - Etiology initially thought to be \ndue to trauma but it's unclear if this is feasible given that \nthe IPH is deep and there is no obvious trauma seen on the \npatient's head. The thought is that the IPH occurred and \nsubsequently had a fall because of it. Due to the location and \nsmall size of the hemorrhage it is possible it is a bleed in a \nvessel with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. No neurosurgical \nintervention was recommended. Anticoagulation was initially held \niso of bleeding, but after a repeat head CT scan which showed no \nchange in IPH size apixaban was restarted, as well as Aspirin.\n\n# Urinary tract infection: although patient has a urine culture \nthat shows fecal contamination, given his altered mental status \nand white count that is improving with antibiotics, he was \nempirically treated for UTI with a 10 day course of cefpodozime \n100 Q12. Repeat urine culture on ___ showed again mixed flora, \nhowever patient was asymptomatic with no white count, fever or \nurinary symptoms. \n \n# Atrial fibrillation  - On Eliquis and Aspirin at home which \nwas held temporarily due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Both \nwere restarted by the time of discharge.\n\n# Hypertension - Initially patient was receiving metoprolol, \nhowever BPs were running high so metoprolol was switched to \nlabetalol 100 BID and BPs lowered around 120-130s systolic. If \npressure continue to be high, labetalol can be uptitrated.  \n\nCHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n\n# BPH with chronic urinary retention - patient with chronic \nfoley \n\n# Sick sinus syndrome - patient with pacemaker \n \n# Depression - Patient continued on Sertraline 50 mg PO DAILY  \n\n>30 minutes was spent on discharge planning and coordination\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \n2. Divalproex (DELayed Release) 125 mg PO DAILY \n3. Docusate Sodium 125 mg PO DAILY \n4. Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID \n5. Metoprolol Succinate XL 200 mg PO DAILY \n6. Senna 8.6 mg PO DAILY \n7. Timolol Maleate 0.5% 1 DROP BOTH EYES BID \n8. Sertraline 50 mg PO DAILY \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.  Labetalol 100 mg PO BID  \n2.  Ramelteon 8 mg PO QHS  \n3.  Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID  \n4.  Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY  \n5.  Divalproex (DELayed Release) 125 mg PO DAILY  \n6.  Docusate Sodium 125 mg PO DAILY  \n7.  Senna 8.6 mg PO DAILY  \n8.  Sertraline 50 mg PO DAILY  \n9.  Timolol Maleate 0.5% 1 DROP BOTH EYES BID  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnosis\n=================\nIntraparenchimal hemorrhage\n\nSecondary Diagnosis\n===================\nUrinary tract infection\nAtrial Fibrillation\nHypertension\nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia\nSick sinus syndrome\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - always.\nLevel of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.\nActivity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or \nwheelchair.\n\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nDear Mr ___,\n\nYou came to ___ as a transfer from ___ after a fall \nfrom your bed. You were found to have a bleed inside your brain. \nPlease see more details listed below about what happened while \nyou were in the hospital and your instructions for what to do \nafter leaving the hospital.\n\nIt was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the \nbest! \n\nSincerely,\nYour ___ Care Team\n\nWHAT WAS DONE WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL:\n- We did a scan of your head which showed a bleed which remained \nstable in size at repeat scan\n- Neurosurgery was consulted and did not think that you needed \nto have surgery\n- A CT of your chest showed a fracture in one of your ribs which \nprobably happened when you fell from the bed\n- We did an analysis of your urine which showed you have a \nurinary tract infection, so we treated you for that infection \nwith antibiotics. You completed the course of antibiotics in the \nhospital\n- We initially held your anticoagulation since you had a brain \nbleed, but we restarted both Aspirin and Apixaban by the time of \nyour discharge\n- We monitored your blood pressure carefully and we made a \nchange in your heart medication\n- You had an EEG (a tests that monitors the electrical activity \nof your brain) which showed no evidence of seizure activity\n\nWHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL:\n- Please follow up with your health care providers at the \nnursing facility as well as with your other providers (see \nbelow)\n- Please take all of your medications as prescribed (see below).\n- Seek medical attention if you have Dizziness or \nlightheadedness, Numbness or tingling, Change in vision, \nConfusion, Headache, Weakness in arm, leg, or face\nDifficulty walking, Difficulty talking, Loss of balance, \nIncontinence of urine or stool, Difficulty urinating, Blood in \nurine, Foul smelling urine, Leg pain, Leg swelling, Leg redness, \nShortness of breath, Chest pain or other symptoms of concern. \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",
