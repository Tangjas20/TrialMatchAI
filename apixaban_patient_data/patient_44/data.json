Has hx MDR UTIs, E coli susceptible to ceftazidime and\nmeropenem. No current dysuria or urinary symptoms, transitioned\nfrom ceftazidine to fosfomycin. Completed fosfomycin q48H x3 \ndoses prior to discharge with resolution of symptoms.\n\n# DVT\nNoted to have bilateral ___ edema on admission. LENIs revealed\npartially occlusive thrombus of L superficial femoral vein\nextending into popliteal vein, and partially occlusive subacute\nto chronic thrombus within R superficial femoral vein. Had been\noff AC on admission due to history of hemorrhagic stroke; \nresumed\napixaban based on DVT. Loaded with apixaban 10MG BID for 1 week, \nongoing at time of discharge, should be transitioned to apixaban \n5MG BID on ___.\n\n# Adrenal Insufficiency\n# Hypoglycemia\n# Hyperkalemia\nPatient on chronic steroids for renal transplant. This admission\nhad hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia concerning for \nadrenal insufficiency in setting of physiologic stress, i.e. \ninfection (UTI). AM Cortisol low at 1.8. Cortisol 1.3->6.2 with \ncosyntropin test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. \nHyperkalemia was transient and resolved with dietary changes. \nEvaluated by endocrinology with diagnosis of primary adrenal \ninsufficiency in the setting of adrenal atrophy from chronic \nprednisone use. No concern for other causes of primary adrenal \ninsufficiency given intact mineralocorticoid activity based on \nlabs with only transient hyperK. Per endocrinology \"patient to \ntake double steroid dose for two days if she feel sick or has a \ncold. Furthermore told to triple dose for three days if very \nill.

Given INR 1.8 (higher \nthan would anticipate on apixaban) in setting of malnutrition \nand prolonged poor PO intake, possible nutritional component of \ncoagulopathy contributing to bleeding, dosed PO vitamin K. INR \n1.8->1.7 with vitamin K, re-dosed on ___. Bleeding stabilized \nprior to discharge, hemoglobin remaining stable. Note mild \nhypofibrinogenemia (180s, then 205 on discharge, without any \nFFP/cryo). \n\n# Malnutrition\n# Hypoalbuminemia\n# Poor PO intake\nAlbumin 2.5 on arrival with mild proteinuria. ___ swelling likely\ndue primarily to DVT, but may also be some element of\nhypoalbuminemia contributing. Poor PO intake due to patient's\ndietary restrictions and preferences.
