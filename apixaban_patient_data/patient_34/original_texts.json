Examination notable for \nbibasilar crackles. Labs were notable for normal WBC and mildly \nelevated NT-proBNP ___. CXR without small right pleural \neffusion.  EKG and telemetry notable for afib with poorly \ncontrolled ventricular rates.  No signs infection, dehydration \nor other secondary driver of afib.  Concern was for poorly \ncontrolled atrial fibrillation leading to acute diastolic CHF \ndue to increased heart rates.  Patient was diuresed with bolus \ndoses of IV furosemide with improvement in symptoms and \nresolution of hypoxia. Cardiology were consulted for \nconsideration of TEE/DCCV due to concern she might not be \ntolerating atrial fibrillation from heart failure perspective.  \nTEE demonstrated spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium, \nand DCCV had to be aborted.  Unclear if this was \nsecondary to missed dose of apixaban on day prior to admission, \nor patient being on the dose-reduced dosing of apixaban.  Per \ndiscussion with cardiology, increased apixaban to 5mg BID.  \nMetoprolol was up-titrated to achieve better rate and symptom \ncontrol. Patient achieved euvolemia, thought to be 132lbs.  Due \nto concern that as her heart rate improved her diuretic need \nwould decrease (see hyponatremia below) risk/benefit was felt to \nfavor discharge on PO furosemide 20mg every other day to start \non ___.  Scheduled patient follow-up with PCP ___ ___ \nfor weight check and Chem-10 check to ensure diuretic regimen is \nappropriate. Decision if/when to proceed with repeat TEE/DCCV is \ndeferred to outpatient cardiologist.\n\n# Hyponatremia\nCourse notable for mild hyponatremia.  ___ have initially \nrepresented hypervolemic, but then worsened--to 132 as she \ncontinued to be diuresed.  Suspect the latter component related \nto diuresis below dry weight (hypovolemic).  Sodium improved to \n135 with changing to every other day diuretic regimen.  \nFollow-up as above. \n \n# GERD\nContinued omeprazole 20mg BID. \n\n# Hypothyroidism\nContinued levothyroxine 88mcg daily.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia \nPatient no longer taking pravastatin as an outpatient.\n\n# Open angle glaucoma \nContinued dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% Ophth left eye BID.\n\n====================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n\n[] DIURESIS: patient should have repeat Chem-10 on ___ and \nweight check to ensure appropriate diuretic regimen\n[] AF: discussion regarding future ___ is deferred to \noutpatient cardiologist\n[] ___: patient should receive four weeks of \nuninterrupted anticoagulation and repeat TEE prior to future \n___\n[] HYPONATREMIA: patient should have repeat sodium on ___\n[] CONTACT: patient would prefer all information be discussed \nwith her and her granddaughter only; no information should be \ngiven to her daughter without permission\n\n=============================================\n# CODE: Full   \n# CONTACT: ___, granddaughter, ___\n\n> 30 minutes spent on discharge\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.
