Consider infection in the proper clinical setting. TEE A 2.1 cm THROMBUS is seen in the left atrium. There is moderate/severe spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial appendage. There is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. There is mild tricuspid regurgitation. Normal left ventricular function. DISCHARGE LABS: 06:22AM BLOOD WBC-4.8 RBC-4.24 Hgb-13.2 Hct-41.2 MCV-97 MCH-31.1 MCHC-32.0 RDW-13.1 RDWSD-47.2* Plt 06:22AM BLOOD Glucose-91 UreaN-17 Creat-0.6 Na-135 K-4.3 Cl-98 HCO3-24 AnGap-13 06:22AM BLOOD Calcium-9.3 Phos-3.4 Mg-2.5 Brief Hospital Course: This is an year old female with past medical history of atrial fibrillation recently started on apixaban and metoprolol, admitted with acute diastolic CHF, palpitations in setting of poorly controlled heart rates, status post diuresis and augmented rate control able to be discharged to assisted living ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES: # Acute diastolic CHF # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure # Persistent atrial fibrillation Presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion, subacute fatigue, and worsening lower extremity edema. Examination notable for bibasilar crackles. Labs were notable for normal WBC and mildly elevated NT-proBNP . CXR without small right pleural effusion. EKG and telemetry notable for afib with poorly controlled ventricular rates. No signs infection, dehydration or other secondary driver of afib. Concern was for poorly controlled atrial fibrillation leading to acute diastolic CHF due to increased heart rates. Patient was diuresed with bolus doses of IV furosemide with improvement in symptoms and resolution of hypoxia. Cardiology were consulted for consideration of TEE/DCCV due to concern she might not be tolerating atrial fibrillation from heart failure perspective. TEE demonstrated spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium, and DCCV had to be aborted. Unclear if this was secondary to missed dose of apixaban on day prior to admission, or patient being on the dose-reduced dosing of apixaban. Per discussion with cardiology, increased apixaban to 5mg BID. Metoprolol was up-titrated to achieve better rate and symptom control. Patient achieved euvolemia, thought to be 132lbs. Due to concern that as her heart rate improved her diuretic need would decrease (see hyponatremia below) risk/benefit was felt to favor discharge on PO furosemide 20mg every other day to start on . Scheduled patient follow-up with PCP for weight check and Chem-10 check to ensure diuretic regimen is appropriate. Decision if/when to proceed with repeat TEE/DCCV is deferred to outpatient cardiologist. # Hyponatremia Course notable for mild hyponatremia. have initially represented hypervolemic, but then worsened to 132 as she continued to be diuresed. Suspect the latter component related to diuresis below dry weight (hypovolemic). Sodium improved to 135 with changing to every other day diuretic regimen. Follow-up as above. # GERD Continued omeprazole 20mg BID. # Hypothyroidism Continued levothyroxine 88mcg daily. # Hyperlipidemia Patient no longer taking pravastatin as an outpatient. # Open angle glaucoma Continued dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% Ophth left eye BID. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] DIURESIS: patient should have repeat Chem-10 on and weight check to ensure appropriate diuretic regimen [] AF: discussion regarding future is deferred to outpatient cardiologist [] : patient should receive four weeks of uninterrupted anticoagulation and repeat TEE prior to future [] HYPONATREMIA: patient should have repeat sodium on [] CONTACT: patient would prefer all information be discussed with her and her granddaughter only; no information should be given to her daughter without permission # CODE: Full # CONTACT: , granddaughter, > 30 minutes spent on discharge Medications on Admission: 1. Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID 2. Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY 3. Dorzolamide 2%/Timolol 0.5% Ophth. 1 DROP LEFT EYE BID 4. Omeprazole 20 mg PO BID 5. Latanoprost 0.005% Ophth.

Omeprazole 20 mg PO BID Discharge Disposition: Home With Service Facility: Discharge Diagnosis: # Acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction exacerbation # Persistent atrial fibrillation # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure # Left atrial thrombus # Hyponatremia Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. , WHY DID YOU COME TO THE HOSPITAL? You were admitted to the hospital as you were having shortness of breath and worsening leg swelling WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL? You were given IV medication to remove the extra fluid from your body You underwent an echocardiogram which showed a clot in your heart; as such we did not attempt cardioversion We increased your medication to slow your heart rate to help control your palpitations You were transitioned to an oral diuretic to prevent fluid from building back up again WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? Please follow-up with all of your outpatient providers as advised It is important you take all of your medications as prescribed It was a pleasure taking care of you!
