There is moderate \nsymmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy with a normal cavity size. The relative wall \nthickness is increased with increased wall\nthickness, most c/w concentric hypertrophy. There is normal \nregional left ventricular systolic function.\nModerately dilated right ventricular cavity with low normal free \nwall motion. The aortic sinus diameter\nis normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for \ngender. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are\nmildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is \nmild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral\nvalve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve \nprolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral\nregurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. \nThe tricuspid valve leaflets appear\nstructurally normal. There is moderate [2+] tricuspid \nregurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is a very small circumferential \npericardial effusion. There are no 2D or\nDoppler echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.\n\nIMPRESSION: 1) Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy \nwith normal cavity size and\nregional/global biventricular systolic function. 2) Mild to \nmoderate pulmonary systolic arterial\nhypertension in setting of moderate tricuspid regurgitation and \nmoderate increase in RV size and\nlow normal RV systolic function. 3) No specific \nechocardiographic evidence of structural cardiac\ncause of syncope identified.\nCompared with the prior TTE (images not available for review) of \n___, the findings are\nsimilar.\n\nDischarge labs: \n___ 08:20AM BLOOD Glucose-110* Creat-1.5* Na-147 K-4.0 \nHCO3-26 AnGap-___, ___, with HFpEF, AF (apixaban), HTN\npresenting after syncopal episode due to volume depletion \nrelated\nto over-diuresis with associated hypernatremia and ___.\n\nACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:\n#Syncope\n#Volume Depletion\n#Mild acute diastolic heart failure \n#HTN\nSyncopal episode was likely orthostatic in the setting of\nover-diuresis with recent increase in torsemide from 40mg -->\n60mg.  Per his daughter, he has otherwise been eating and\ndrinking normally, had no other medication changes, has not been\nill, but he can be a picky eater. His weight is down on \nadmission\n(223.3 lbs this morning from 238 lbs at last cardiology\nappointment on ___. Orthostatics were negative, though were\nmeasured after he received IVF. TTE in the ED without\nfindings to explain syncope. He was monitored on telemetry where \nthere were no arrhythmia events. He received ___ @100cc/hr \n___ cc given on ___.  Torsemide was originally held, but \nrestarted at 50mg on ___.  He tolerated this well, and on ___, \nhis Cr was normal.  We discussed with his daughter present, that \npredicting the future with one dose of Torsemide is not going to \nalways be optimal.  The most effective way to understand the \ncorrect dose is to monitor weight daily.  If it changes by 2 \npounds or 1kg in 24 hours, he should contact his cardiologist to \nsee if dose of Torsemide should be changed.  They understood and \nagreed.  \n\n___\nCr 2.2 from baseline 1.7. Improved to 1.6 on ___ and 1.5 on \n___. \nLisinopril was initially held, but restarted on discharge.  \n\n#Hypernatremia - as high as 153, but improved to 147 prior to \ndischarge.  \n\n#Elevated Lactate - improved with hydration; no evidence of\ninfection \n\n#BPH: finsteride\n#AF: metoprolol/apixaban\n\nI spent > 30 min in face-to-face counseling and coordination of \ncare in discharge planning.  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Torsemide 60 mg PO DAILY \n2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO DAILY \n3. Metoprolol Succinate XL 100 mg PO BID \n4. Finasteride 5 mg PO DAILY \n5. Atorvastatin 40 mg PO QPM \n6. Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID \n7.
