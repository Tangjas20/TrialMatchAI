Severe intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation without a \ndefinite \nobstructing lesion identified on this examination.  Gallbladder \nis distended.  No gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic \nfluid is seen, but ensuing acute cholecystitis is not excluded.  \nThere is also main pancreatic ductal dilatation.  MRCP or ERCP \nshould be considered to evaluate for an obstruction lesion.  \nAmpullary stenosis is a consideration. \n2. Long segment of sigmoid colon demonstrating circumferential \nthickening and possible subtle adjacent fat stranding, which may \nbe due to infectious or inflammatory colitis.  Diverticulosis, \nhowever the fat stranding is not focal to any single \ndiverticula. \n3. Severe degenerative changes within the lumbar spine with \nsevere endplate irregularity at well L1-2 and L3-4, most likely \ndegenerative, however there are no priors for comparisons. '\n\nEndoscopic Ultrasound/EGD (___):\nThe bile duct was imaged at the level of the porta-hepatis, head \nof the pancreas and ampulla. The maximum diameter of the bile \nduct was 18 mm. The bile duct was markedly dilated but otherwise \nnormal in appearance. The dilation extended to the level of the \nampulla. No intrinsic stones or sludge were noted.\nThe ampulla was located at the rim of a large diverticulum - \notherwise normal. (biopsy)\nOtherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum\n\nPrevious partial gastrectomy with Billroth 1 gastroenterostomy \nof the stomach body (biopsy)\nDiverticulum in the area of the papilla\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is an ___ y/o woman with history of HTN, CHF (LVEF \nunknown), atrial fibrillation on warfarin, SSS s/p PPM who \npresented for diarrhea and abdominal pain, and was found to have \nC. diff. \n \nMs. ___ is an ___ y/o woman with history of HTN, CHF (LVEF \nunknown), atrial fibrillation on warfarin, SSS s/p PPM who \npresented for diarrhea and abdominal pain, and was found to have \nC. diff. \n\n#C. diff: Patient finished a course of clindamycin in early \n___ for pneumonia and thought she was experiencing more \ndiarrhea than usual. During her rehab stay, patient was \ndiagnosed with C.diff and treated with a 10 ___ course of \nantibiotics. Repeat C.diff studies were sent during this \nhospitalization and returned positive. The patient was started \non treatment with PO vanocmycin. She should continue vancomycin \nuntil seen by a GI doctor ___ 1 = ___. Because she already \nfailed a full course of c diff treatment, she may warrant \ntreatment for longer than the usual two weeks. Exact course to \nbe determined by GI.\n\n#BRBPR: Patient noticed specks of bright red blood after \ndiarrhea on ___ with some lower abdominal pain. Patient had no \nfurther drops in H/H noted and was hemodynamically stable. CT \nscan showed colitis. Presumed secondary to c. diff infection. No \nintervention deemed appropriate given very minor nature of \nbleeding.\n\n#Intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation: The patient was \nfound to have severe intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation, \nwith main pancreatic duct dilation and dilation of gallbladder \nwithout evidence of infection without a definite obstructing \nlesion on CT scan. Gallbladder, even though distended and filled \nwith fluid, appears to be draining adequately given no rise in \nalk phos or total bilirubin. Patient's pacemaker was \nincompatible with MCRP so patient had an endoscopic ultrasound \n___ which showed ductal dilatation, but no obstructing stones \nor mass that might cause the ductal dilatation. Biopsies were \ntaken and were pending at time of discharge. \n\n#Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient with mild symmetric \nleft ventricular hypertrophy w preserved systolic function and \nECHO showing LVEF 55%. Previous CTA showed mild evidence of pulm \nedema and proBNP was 2393- stable from last admission. Her \nstress test did not show any abnormality. Patient's diuretic was \nheld in the setting of diarrhea. This should be restarted as the \ndiarrhea resolves. \n\n#Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, V paced \nwith ICD, INR 2.0 on admission. CHADS2VASC 3 (age, dCHF, HTN). \nPatient's xarelto was held prior to Endoscopic U/S and resumed \non ___. Atenolol 25 mg daily was continued for rate control. \n  \n# CAD risk:  Continued atorvastatin 40 mg  and BP control with \namlodipine/atenolol  \n\n# Hypertension: continued amlodipine/atenolol.  \n\n# Seizure Disorder: continued home keppra  \n\n# Depression: continued home venlafaxine  \n\n# Restless leg syndrome: continued home pramipexole  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n====================\n- We are holding patient's Lasix because of her diarrhea. She \nappears euvolemic at discharge. PCP may resume ___ as diarrhea \nresolves if appropriate.\n\n- The patient may have refractory c. diff, and she should \ncontinue taking vancomycin until seen by a GI doctor. 12 days of \nVancomycin prescribed at discharge. At PCP follow up, please \nprescribe additional Vancomycin to cover her until she sees GI \non ___.\n\n# CONTACT: ___ (daughter) ___ ___ (son) \n___ \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
