\non Cellcept and now initiated on IVIG), neurogenic bladder \n(straight caths BID) presenting with fever and acute on chronic \nb/l leg weakness x 1d, likely due to E.coli UTI with \nrecrudescence of her Devic's in the setting of infection. Home \nCellcept was resumed and patient underwent initiation of IVIG \ntherapy. Following IVIG infusions, patient was noted to be \nneutropenic. Given her neutropenia, additional medication was \nalso discontinued including Bactrim that may be contribute to \nneutropenia, however neutropenia was likely linked to IVIG \ninfusions given ANC declined soon after infusion, counts will \nneed to be monitored to ensure recovery, likely two weeks from \ninfusion (given on ___ and ___.  ANC on discharge was 640.  \nWBC 1.6 (40% PMN)\n\nPatient was also noted to have DVT in right posterior tibial \nvein on ___. Patient c/o of calf pain bilaterally, then \nreported pain in right calf and left calf, she then reported \npain worse in right calf after DVT was found. She is unable to \ndescribe when pain started. She has no history of DVTs and given \nimmobility, DVT was thought to be provoked in the setting of \nimmobility. She will follow-up with hematology as an outpatient \nto assess duration of anticoagulation and further \nhypercoagulable testing if needed. Consider repeating lower \nextremity ultrasound as outpatient.  Choice of anticoagulation \nwas initially lovenox and then anticoagulation was changed to \napixiban for which she will take 10mg bid for 7days and then 5mg \nbid for 3 months.\n\nShe will follow-up with neurology as outpatient for IVIG \ninfusions which will be set up by her outpatient neurologist. \nShe was supposed to follow-up with rheumatology as an outpatient \ngiven the concern for overlapping autoimmune diseases with \nneuromyelitis optica. APLS and additional rheumatology labs can \nbe sent as an outpatient.\n\nPatient also reported hemorrhoidal bleeding at home. She was \nnoted to have several bloody bowel movements while hospitalized. \nPatient was prepped for colonoscopy, however prep was \ninadequate. Given her neutropenia, colonoscopy was then \npostponed. While she was hospitalized, she requested colonoscopy \nto be completed as inpatient given she would not be able to \nmanage prep at home, she was prepped second time for ___, \nhowever her ANC again was noted to be low, and colonoscopy was \ncancelled. She will follow-up for outpatient colonoscopy in \nseveral months as outpatient, she will need to call to schedule. \n\n\n# Fever:\n# E.coli urinary tract infection:\n# Neurogenic bladder:\nPatient with isolated fever ___ in setting of Cellcept use \n(which predisposes to viral illnesses, including CMV, although \nIgM negative). Likely secondary to E.coli UTI (given \ndysuria/suprapubic tenderness), less likely viral URI in setting \nof odynophagia/congestion and sick contact (influenza \nA/Bnegative). CXR without infiltrate. Of note, patient straight \ncaths twice a day and has a hx of MDR- UTIs, for which she was \npreviously seen by ID and trialed on suppressive fosfomycin. \nStarted on Zosyn given historical resistance pattern, narrowed \nto Bactrim with plan for 14d course ___, through ___. \nBactrim was discontinued on ___ given neutropenia and concern \nfor possible contribution if ongoing. Repeat UA was negative for \ninfection. Repeat urine culture may have been contaminant and \ngiven negative UA, further antibiotics were held. Outpatient ID \nreferral given hx of MDR infections and prior prophylaxis. Home \ncellcept initially held in setting of infection, resumed ___ \nafter discussion with outpatient neurologist. Home oxybutynin \nwas held during hospitalization and on discharge and can be \nresumed as indicated by her PCP or neurologist as outpatient. \n\n# B/l lower extremity weakness (R>L):\n# Devic's disease:\nConcerning for recrudescence in setting of infection, now \nimproving with treatment of UTI as above. Less likely disease \nprogression. No saddle anesthesia or new B/B incontinence to \nsuggest cord compression. Neurology consulted initially, \nrecommended against reimaging. After discussion with patient's \nneurologist, Dr. ___ (which was scheduled for initiation \nas an outpatient) was administered, with 55g given on ___ and \nanother 55g on ___. She was noted to be neutropenic following \ninfusions. She is being discharged to rehab for further \nstrengthening. She will f/u with Dr. ___ as an outpatient and \nwill need IVIG infusions as indicated by neurology. She will \nalso need follow-up with rheumatology as outpatient given \noverlap of additional autoimmune disorders and neuromyelitis \noptica.\n\n# Elevated ALT, alk phos:\n# GIB:\nDyspepsia/nausea initially, now resolved, but ALT mildly \nelevated with slowly uptrending alk phos. RUQ U/S  showed no e/o \nbiliary obstruction. Home ranitidine was continued. Pt developed \nGIBleeding on ___, with several bloody bowel movements. Pt had \nno hemodynamic stability throughout this time, and CBC remained \nstable. No transfusions were given. GI was consulted, who \nplanned a colonoscopy, but the prep on ___ was inadequate. \nRepeat colonoscopy on ___ was cancelled after prep after \npatient's ANC was noted to be low. Patient was discharged with \nplan for outpatient ___, which is ordered, but patient will \nneed to call to schedule (see contact information in d/c \nsummary). \n\n# Leg cramping: Unclear etiology but chronic condition. \nElectrolytes WNL, CK wnl. Received occasional tramadol PRN with \ngood effect, along with home gabapentin. She was occasionally \ngiven Tizanidine with some improvement as well. \n\n# Insomnia: Continued home Ativan 0.5mg QHS; made standing while \nhospitalized.\n\n# RLE DVT: found on ___ in right posterior tibial vein. No \nprior history of DVTs, likely provoked in setting of immobility. \nContinue Lovenox 60 mg BID while in rehab, will follow-up with \nhematology to discuss length of duration. ___ consider changing \nto DOAC when seen by hematology. Her mobility may improve as her \nneuromyelitis optica flare may improve. \n\n# Orthostatic hypotension: patient had intermittent orthostatic \nhypotension that resolved.\n\nTRANSITIONAL:\n[ ] f/u with neurology for further IVIG\n[ ] f/u with ID for consideration of UTI suppression therapy\n[ ] has previously been referred to rheumatology for joint pain; \ndoes not yet appear to have been seen, will need follow-up as \noutpatient, APLS serologies as outpatient\n[ ] schedule colonoscopy as an outpatient\n[ ] straight cath BID (patient does herself)\n[ ] follow-up with hematology as outpatient to discuss duration \nof anticoagulation, \n[ ] repeat CBC w/diff weekly, monitor ANC \n[ ] consider repeating lower extremity ultrasound as outpatient\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
