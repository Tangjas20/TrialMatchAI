The right \natrium is mildly enlarged. There is no\nevidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is ___\nmmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \na normal cavity size. There is normal\nregional and global left ventricular systolic function. \nQuantitative biplane left ventricular ejection\nfraction is 70 % (normal 54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index \nis high (>4.0 L/min/m2). There is no\nresting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Diastolic \nparameters are indeterminate. Normal right\nventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid \nannular plane systolic excursion\n(TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for \ngender with a poorly visualized ascending\naorta. There is a normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) are moderately\nthickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is trace \naortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets\nappear structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There \nis mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The\npulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets \nappear structurally normal. There is mild\nto moderate [___] tricuspid regurgitation. There is SEVERE \npulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild \nsymmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global \nbiventricular systolic function. Mild\nmitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology. The normal \nright ventricular cavity size and\nfree wall motion suggests the PA systolic hypertension is \nchronic.\n\nCT Chest ___\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nNECK, THORACIC INLET, AXILLAE AND CHEST WALL: \nCoarse calcifications in the left thyroid lobe, otherwise the \nthyroid is \nunremarkable.  No enlarged axillary or thoracic inlet lymph \nnodes.  There are \nno chest wall abnormalities.  Severe atherosclerotic \ncalcifications in the \nhead and neck arteries could be hemodynamically significant. \n  \nMEDIASTINUM AND HILA: \nEsophagus is unremarkable.  Central mediastinal nodes ranging \n3-7 mm by CT \nsize criteria.  Hilar contours show evidence of lymph nodes. \n  \nHEART, PERICARDIUM AND VASCULATURE: \nMild cardiomegaly.  No pericardial effusion.  Minimal \natherosclerotic \ncalcifications in the coronary arteries, mild in the aortic \nvalve leaflets and \nmoderate in the aortic arch.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are \nnormal in \ncaliber throughout.  Low blood pool density suggests underlying \nanemia. \n  \nLUNGS, AIRWAYS, AND PLEURA: \nDiffuse bilateral centrilobular branching nodules some with \nareas of \ncoalescence (5:138) specially in the bilateral lower lobes where \nmore \nprominent areas of peribronchovascular consolidations are noted \n(5:223, 230).  \nScattered calcified granulomas are unchanged.  Small right \nnonhemorrhagic \ndependent pleural effusion with associated compressive \natelectasis is \nmoderately worsened when compared to the immediate prior study \nand likely \nrelated to the ongoing infectious process. \n  \nThe airways are patent to the subsegmental levels with mild \nbronchial wall \nthickening, no bronchiectasis or mucus plugging.  Moderate upper \nlobe \npredominant centrilobular emphysema. \n  \nCHEST CAGE: \nUnchanged appearance of the recent nondisplaced fractures in the \nmid sternum \nand in the anterior aspect of the right fourth and fifth ribs \n(5: 142, 175, \n130).  Striated pattern of osteopenia without evidence of \ncompressive or \npathologic fractures.  No lytic or sclerotic bone lesions \nworrisome for \nmalignancy.  Mild dorsal spondylosis. \n  \nUPPER ABDOMEN: \nThis study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic findings, within \nthese \nlimitations there are multiple hepatic hypodense lesions which \ncould \ncorrespond to hepatic cysts or biliary hamartomas.  Multiple \ncalcified foci in \nthe spleen suggest prior granulomatous infection.  Adrenals are \nunremarkable. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nWorsening areas of centrilobular branching nodules specially in \nthe bilateral \nlower lobes with new peribronchovascular consolidations suggest \nevolving \nepisode of aspiration.  Enlarging small nonhemorrhagic dependent \nright pleural \neffusion with associated atelectasis is likely secondary to the \nongoing \ninfectious process, a superimposed pneumonia within the \natelectasis can not be \nexcluded, especially in the absence of IV contrast.  ___ week \nfollow-up \nimaging is recommended after treatment to document complete \nresolution. \n  \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ week follow-up imaging to document \ncomplete \nresolution of the ongoing infectious process. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is an ___ year old female, with a PMH significant for \nAfib (Eliquis), COPD (on home O2), HTN, and CHF. She was \ntransferred to ___ from OSH (___) on ___. This \npatient was admitted to ___ from ___ after a MVC. \nImaging at that time showed that she had sustained a sternal \nfracture, right ___ rib fractures, and BLE skin tears. She was \noriginally admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team for further \ncare. She was seen by physical therapy and cleared for discharge \nhome on ___. However, that same day she presented to \n___ with complaints of SOB and was admitted for c/s for \nPNA vs COPD vs CHF. She was started on IV antibiotics \nempirically, steroid therapy (prednisone), and diuresed with IV \nfurosemide. She did require ICU level of care due to needing \npositive pressure (BiPAP). Over her hospital course she was \ntreated for CAP/Aspiration Pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, \npersistent hypoxemia with gradual improvement. She had Severe \nhyponatremia ___ SIADH which improved w tolvaptan, hypertonic \nsaline, and fluid restriction with nutritional supplementation.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n========================\n[ ] Please ensure maintaining adequate sats on ambulation at PCP \n___ and eval if O2 is stable\n[ ] ___ in plastics clinic in 2 weeks for wound eval and ? \ngrafting\n[ ] Elevated PASP on TTE while inpatient. Would repeat TTE in 3 \nmonths\n[ ] Please check Na at PCP ___ and consider liberalizing fluid \nrestriction \n\nBrief ICU Course (___):\nOn arrival to the ICU she was stable on 3L of oxygen by nasal \ncannula. She had minimal rib pain ___ in severity, and moderate \nshortness of breath. No fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. \nLaboratory testing reassuring. She was continued on ceftriaxone \nand azithromycin, as well as prednisone and standing duonebs. \nShe was called-out to the floor in stable condition.\n\nSurgical Floor Course (___):\nWhile on the floor, the patient was hemodynamically stable. She \nwas complaining of shortness of breath, but was stable on ___ L \nnasal cannula. She underwent a chest CT which was concerning for \naspiration pneumonia, so her antibiotic coverage was expanded to \nIV zosyn and vancomycin. She was also continued on duonebs, home \nCOPD medications, furosemide, and prednisone. She was also given \na one time dose of 20mg IV furosemide. \n\nFloor Course ___\nWhile on the floor her shortness of breath was thought to be \nsecondary to a COPD exacerbation as opposed to a true aspiration \npneumonia.  Her vancomycin and Zosyn were discontinued and she \nwas started on a 5-day course of prednisone and azithromycin for \na COPD flare.  She was also diuresed with IV Lasix for clinical \nsigns of fluid overload.  Her course on the floor was \ncomplicated by hyponatremia secondary to SIADH requiring \ntransfer to the ICU for further management. \n\nBrief ICU Course ___\nThe patient was found to have an initial sodium of 117 and Urine \nlytes demonstrated a SIADH process. The sodium remained low \ndespite adequate fluid restriction and the patient's Na was \ntrended q2 hours and with intermittent hypertonic boluses that \nwere directed with the assistance of the nephrology consultants. \nDespite these efforts the patient was unable to maintain her Na \nwithout severe free water restriction and hypertonic saline \nboluses and therefore tolvaptan was initiated. Na improved w a \nfew days of tolvaptan. The patient's heart failure was managed \nwith an intermittent doses of Lasix in an attempt to achieve \neuvolemia. The patient's oxygen requirements improved throughout \nher stay and she was discharged on a stable concentration.  \n\nMedical floor course: ___-\nShe was initially continued on tolvaptan With stable Na. This \nwas then held and she was put on fluid restriction and ensures \nTID with stable Na. She was given lasix 40 mg daily for \npersistent hypoxia and IS encouraged. She had a slow improvement \nin her shortness of breath due to ongoing heart failure and COPD \nsymptoms and was eventually discharged home requiring oxygen \nonly at night which was her baseline. She was seen by ___ \nwho recommended ___ in their clinic for evaluation of whether \nshe may need a skin graft at that time.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
