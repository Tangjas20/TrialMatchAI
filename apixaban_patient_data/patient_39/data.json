She has been having gradually increasing shortness of \nbreath. Yesterday when the daughter visited, the patient could \nnot comfortably talk in complete sentences. Additionally she had \ndeveloped a white foamy cough. Overnight, she complained to the \nhospice nurse and was given ___. This is a new medication for \nher.

The mitral leaflets \nappear structurally normal with\nno mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. \nThe tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There \nis mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial \npericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Adequate image quality. Right ventricular cavity \ndilation with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary \nartery hypertension c/w acute or acute on chronic pulmonary \nprocess (e.g. pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, etc.).

She was treated with a Lasix drip, \nBiPAP, and brief pressors in the MICU. She was found to have a \nPE and initiated on anticoagulation. Eventually transitioned to \nPO Lasix prn dyspnea/weight gain to which her respiratory status \nreturned to baseline, and she was discharged to skilled nursing \nwith the probable eventual transition back to hospice.\n\nACUTE ISSUES: \n=========================\n# Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure\n# Interstitial lung disease (___)\n# Acute on chronic heart failure with a preserved ejection \nfraction (LVEF 75%)\n# Acute pulmonary embolism:\nPatient presented with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory \nfailure, likely secondary to exacerbation of her diastolic heart \nfailure in the setting of inadequate prn Lasix at hospice. The \npatient was admitted to the MICU for BiPAP. She was treated with \na Lasix drip, and transitioned to PO torsemide. Torsemide was \nlater held as patient felt to be overdiuresed. She has remained \neuvolemic off diuretics. She continued to have an increased \noxygen requirement above her baseline and had a TTE which showed \ninterval worsening in pulmonary hypertension and RV dilatation \nconcerning for pulmonary embolism. Underwent CTA and \nsubsequently found to have PE involving the lobar and segmental \nbranches of the right and lower lobes and segmental branches of \nthe right upper lobe. Patient was started on apixaban. \nRespiratory status has been stable on Oxymizer titrated between \n___ L.\n\n# Right lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli\n# Moderate pulmonary hypertension\nHad a TTE which showed interval worsening in pulmonary \nhypertension and RV dilatation concerning for pulmonary \nembolism. Underwent CTA and subsequently found to have PE \ninvolving the lobar and segmental branches of the right and \nlower lobes and segmental branches of the right upper lobe. \nPatient was started on apixaban 10 mg twice daily and will \ncontinue on this dose through ___ and transition to apixaban 5 \nmg twice a day for at least 6 months.\n\n# Obstructive sleep apnea: \nPrescribed home BiPAP, to which she is ___. Declined \ninpatient BiPAP for OSA previously. Given this, she was not \ndischarged with BiPAP for this indication.\n\n# Shock:\nThe patient became hypotensive upon initiation of BiPAP, briefly \nrequiring pressors in the emergency room. Hypotension was likely \ndue to the increased intrathoracic pressure in the setting of \nBiPAP. Pressors were quickly weaned off, and she remained \nnormotensive throughout the remainder of hospitalization. \n\n# Goals of care: \nAt last hospitalization, there was clear documentation that the \npatient wished for discharge to hospice, was DNR/DNI, and agreed \nto no ICU transfer. On the day of admission, patient was feeling \nincreasingly short of breath but was refusing morphine to treat \nair hunger and instead requested to be sent to hospital. \n\nHer no ICU transfers was reversed at hospice. Palliative care \nwas consulted, given their relationship with the patient. \nContinued to have discussions with patient and family about \ntransition to hospice care and possible inpatient hospice. \nUnfortunately, there is a continued disconnect in expectations \nof hospice care. Patient is disinterested in inpatient hospice \nbecause culturally she does not feel comfortable in a facility \nwith people who are passing away.\n\nPatient's daughters felt ___ facility was allowing her to \ndie instead of improving her breathing and making her \ncomfortable with medications, though advocating for some hospice \nservices. This conversation will be ongoing. For now it was \ndecided that ___ would be discharged to a skilled \nnursing facility that has the ability to transition to hospice. \n\n# Symptomatic treatment of shortness of breath\nPalliative care was consulted and advised symptomatic management \nof air hunger with morphine. However, there was difficulty \nconvincing patient to take morphine as she associates this with \nher symptoms of dyspnea.\n\n# Mouth burning sensation\nUnclear cause. From more detailed discussion, seems to acutally \nbe a metallic taste in mouth rather than burning. Trialed PO \nlidocaine mouth wash and chlorhexadine oral rinse with \nimprovement in symptoms and will continue at discharge. \n\n# Hypertension: \nHer losartan was held in the setting of hypotension. We will \ncontinue to hold the discharge as blood pressures have been well \ncontrolled off medication.\n\n# Coronary artery disease: \nAspirin was discontinued as patient has ___ interstitial \nlung disease and not within goals of care \n\n# GERD: \nHer home ranitidine was continued.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n=========================\nDISCHARGE WEIGHT: 75.4kg\n\n[] Chronic resp failure due to end stage ILD: Patient on ___ \noxymyzer at baseline now. Will be discharged with hospice \nservices and on morphine PRN for air hunger. \n[] Pulmonary embolism: Patient started on apixaban for pulmonary \nembolism which contributed to heart failure as above. Currently \non 10 mg twice daily to be continued through ___. Starting \n___, patient should be transitioned to apixaban 5 mg twice \ndaily\n[] Discharged off home lasix. Suspect patient will not need \nmaintenance diuretic as has poor p.o. intake at baseline. Please \nmonitor patient's weight and volume status, and will prescribe \n___ lasix as needed if felt to be overloaded.\n[] Patient's losartan was held at discharge. Please monitor \nblood pressures and restart as appropriate.\n[] Continue discussions with patient regarding her goals of \ncare, specifically about hospital transfers versus inpatient \nhospice.\n[] Aspirin discontinued as now within goals of care.\n[] Sleep apnea: Patient discharged off CPAP as has been refusing \nand ___ lung disease goal is to make her comfortable and \nnot within current goals of care.\n\n# CONTACT: ___ (daughter/HCP) ___,\nSecondary is ___ (daughter) ___\n# Code: DNR/DNI \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were also put on a machine called \nBiPAP to help your breathing. \n- You had a scan of your lungs which showed blood clots and you \nwere started on a medication called apixaban\n- You offered you a medication called morphine to help you \nbreathe more easily. We know that you had intermittently refused \nthis medication in the past and on this admission, but when you \nDID take it, you felt that your breathing was BETTER and your \nrespiratory rate and breathing were much BETTER. We encourage \nyou to continue to take this medication if you feel short of \nbreath. \n- You had quite severe constipation which resolved with an \naggressive medication regimen. We discharged you on a reduced \nversion of this regimen. \n- Your mouth was dry and uncomfortable, we gave you a mouth wash \nwhich felt good. \n\nWHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?\n- We informed your skilled nursing facility that the water pill \nyou initially were given SHOULD be given IF you are gaining \nweight and it can be tried on an as needed basis for volume \noverload. \n- If you have not had a bowel movement in over 2 days please \ntake your miralax\n- If you develop blood in your stool call your PCP \n- ___ take all your medicines as described in this paperwork.\n- Please keep your follow up appointments as listed below.\n\nWe wish you all the best,\nYour ___ team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",
