ON admission, surgery \nwas consulted who felt her presentation to be more consistent \nwith gallstone pancreatitis with a stone that had since passed \ngiven improvement in her symptoms at time of transfer. She was \ninitially treated with cipro/flagyl and completed a seven day \ncourse which ended on ___. Advanced endoscopy performed \nan ERCP on ___ which demonstrated a 9mm stone that was \nremoved, and a sphincterotomy performed. LFTs trended down and \nhad normalized ___ to discharge, with exception of AP which \nremained slightly elevated. Patient was treated with \nconservative pancreatitis management and by day of discharge, \nshe was tolerating a regular diet without pain and having bowel \nmovements. Surgery was consulted for possible cholecystectomy, \nbut patient was not interested in undergoing cholecystectomy. \nSurgery felt that given she had a sphincterotomy, was on \nsystemic anticoagulation, and given her age and over all risk \nfactors for surgery that this was a reasonable approach. \n\n# Atrial Fibrillation\n# Bradycardia: Patient experienced bradycardia to ___ on the \nday of her ERCP, thought to be a vagal event, with no pacemaker \nactivity at the time of her event.  Electrophysiology was \nconsulted and and felt this was a vagal episode given her \nhistory of atrial fibrillation and use of beta-blocker. On \npacemaker interrogation, it was assessed to be at the end of its \nknown lifespan based on the time of implant and its model \nnumber. Underwent an uncomplicated generator exchange on ___ \nand was discharged with post-operative antibiotics and intent to \n___ at ___ on ___. Given the \nnote of her atrial fibrillation, clopidogrel was stopped and \napixaban was started as it is a more beneficial medication in \nreducing stroke complications in patients with atrial \nfibrillation after consultation with electrophysiology.  Plavix \nwas not continued as there was no history of recent ACS or \ncoronary or peripheral intervention requiring antiplatelet agent \nand there would be an increased risk of bleeding with a dual \ncombination of Plavix and apixaban. The risks and benefits of \nsystemic anticoagulation were discussed with patient by MD \n___ course. Apixaban prescription for 60 tablets of 2.5 \nmg twice daily prescribed at discharge. Selection of low dose \nchosen given her age greater than ___ years and low BMI.\n\n# HTN: Held home diuretics including Lasix and spironolactone in \nthe setting of fasting for GI procedures. Given stable \noxygenation and lack of any hypervolemia for many days Lasix and \nspironolactone were not resumed on discharge but can be assessed \nat the next outpatient ___\n\n# CKD: Unclear baseline Creatinine, but Cr improved to 1.0\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n[ ] discharged with cephalexin TID for 4 days post-PPM generator \nexchange\n[ ] ___ in cardiology device clinic for PPM check at ___ \non ___\n[ ] check LFTs, and alkaline phosphatase at next clinic \nappointment to ensure resolution. \n[ ] started on low dose apixaban 2.5mg BID for atrial \nfibrillation. ___ MD discussed risks and benefits of systemic \nanticoagulation with patient.  \n[ ] diuretics were held at time of discharge, assess continued \nneed at PCP ___.\n\nTime spent coordinating discharge > 30 minutes\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1. Clopidogrel 75 mg PO DAILY \n2. Spironolactone 25 mg PO DAILY \n3. Metoprolol Succinate XL 50 mg PO DAILY \n4. Furosemide 40 mg PO DAILY \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.  Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN Pain - Mild  \n2.  Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID \nRX *apixaban [Eliquis] 2.5 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth twice a day \nDisp #*60 Tablet Refills:*0 \n3.

Metoprolol Succinate XL 50 mg PO DAILY  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\ngallstone pancreatitis\nsepsis ___ cholangitis\nCholelithiasis\ncholedocholithiasis\natrial fibrillation\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nDear ___,\n\nYou were hospitalized for gallstone pancreatitis which improved \nwith supportive care including antibiotics bowel rest and IV \nfluids. With conservative treatment, you were able to take a \nregular diet. The GI team performed a procedure called an ERCP \non ___ to open up your bile ducts and help the passage of \nthe and any future gallstones. \n\nUsually, in these circumstances we would preform a surgery to \nremove your gallbladder to prevent the recurrence of future \ngallstones, but you informed us that you were not interested in \nundergoing surgery including cholecystectomy given your concerns \nregarding anesthesia and related surgical risks.  We shared with \nyou that sometimes cholecystectomy is performed to reduce risk \nof future gallstone complications given her age and other \nmedical problems including use of anticoagulation this is a fair \ndecision.\n\nWe found that your pacemaker battery was at the end of its life \nspan and electrophysiology  performed generator change on \n___. You tolerated this procedure well. \n\n___ APPOINTMENTS\n- You will need to ___ in the cardiology department device \nclinic in one week (see below) to check your pacemaker)\n- You will need to call your primary care doctor to schedule an \nappointment soon after you leave the hospital.\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES\n- We adjusted your anticoagulation to now be use of apixaban 2.5 \nmg twice a day which is a new medication for you for the \npurposes of reducing stroke related to chronic atrial \nfibrillation.  This medication works differently than Plavix.\n- We advised you to STOP Plavix and only take apixaban at this \ntime.\n- You need to take an antibiotic called Keflex (cephalexin) for \na few days after you leave the hospital to protect against \ninfection at your pacemaker site. \n\nPlease inform any physicians or surgeons that you are taking a \nblood thinner for atrial fibrillation before you go for any \ninvasive procedures as there is at increased risk of bleeding \nwith this medication.  Do not stop apixaban on your own without \ninforming her cardiologist or primary care physician.  Report \nany bleeding bruising weakness to your doctor right away as this \nmay be a sign of internal bleeding related to apixaban and blood \ntest should be performed.\n\nPlease take all medications as prescribed and keep all scheduled \ndoctor's appointments. Seek medical attention if you develop a \nworsening or recurrence of the same symptoms that originally \nbrought you to the hospital, experience any of the warning signs \nlisted below, or have any other symptoms that concern you.\n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you!\nYour ___ Care Team\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",
