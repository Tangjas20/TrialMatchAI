The patient was found \nto have a left intertrochanteric femur fracture and was admitted \nto the orthopedic surgery service. The patient was taken to the \noperating room on ___ R TFN, which the patient tolerated well. \nFor full details of the procedure please see the separately \ndictated operative report. The patient was taken from the OR to \nthe PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory recovery \nfrom anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The patient was \ninitially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, and \nprogressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. The \npatient was given ___ antibiotics and anticoagulation \nper routine. The patient's home medications were continued \nthroughout this hospitalization. The patient worked with ___ who \ndetermined that discharge to rehab was appropriate. The patient \nis weight bearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and \nwill be continued on home  eliquis for DVT prophylaxis. The \npatient will follow up with Dr. ___ routine. \n\nFollowing surgical repair of his r. hip fracture, the patient \nwas transferred to the Medicine team for further management of \npersistent AMS/delirium, atrial fibrillation with RVR, \niatrogenic volume overload, and chronic aspiration requiring \ninitiation of dobhoff feeds as detailed below:\n\nMedicine Hospital Course:\n===================\n\nMr. ___ is an ___ with CAD, Afib on Eliquis, CKD, and RA on \nprednisone admitted for R intratrochanteric fracture from \nmechanical fall s/p operative fixation on ___, with \npost-operative course complicated by pneumonia treated with \nlevofloxacin, a-fib with RVR, and delirium. He ultimately did \nnot recover from his aspiration pnuemonia and associated \ndelirium and was made CMO on ___ and expired the same day.   \n\n#Delirium: \nMild-moderate dementia at baseline. However, independently \nfunctional prior to this hospitalization. Current delirium is \nlikely multifactorial in setting of infection, recent surgery \nwith anesthesia, pain, lack of hearing aids. Repeat CT head \nwithout acute intracranial abnormality (ie chronic subdural \nhematoma). Patient treated for reversible causes including \npneumonia, but still with persistent delirium and he ultimately \nexpired as above. \n\n#GOC: \nMultiple goals of care discussions were held during this \nadmission. Patient is DNR/DNI, but family would like to pursue \ntemporary trial of nutrition support to see if patient can \nrecover through his current delirium. Per family, initially \nwilling to do trial of dobhoff for feeds for now and trial at \n___. His mental status was not improving and he was ultimately \nmade CMO. \n\n#Atrial fibrillation with RVR: \nDiagnosed in ___. Previously on amiodarone, Coumadin. CHADSVASC \n= 3. Now on Eliquis and metop XL 50 mg at home with baseline HRs \nin the ___. At one point during this hospitalization, \ndeveloped persistent RVR to the 110s-150s with no response to IV \nmetop 5 mg x 2. Improved with 15 mg diltiazem push to the ___. \nStable BPs. Likely in the setting of agitation/delirium vs. \npain. Good rate control achieved with regimen of 37.5mg metop \ntartrate q6h. Expired as above. \n\n#Pleural effusion/pulmonary congestion: \nImproving on most recent imaging following diuresis and \nanitibiotics. Likely secondary to iatogrenic volume overload and \nunderlying PNA. Unlikely CHF, as ECHO with preserved EF. Patient \nalso with recurrent episodes of aspiration in setting of \nimpaired swallowing, for which he was placed on strict NPO, \naspiration precautions, and chest ___. ___ was placed for \nenteric feedings. Expired as above. \n\n#Urinary rentention: \nLikely multifactorial. Suspect BPH, recent foley in OR, and \ncurrent sedation. PVR 155 after voiding on ___. Unable to take \ntamsulosin via ___. Expired as above. \n\n#Aspiration risk/poor swallowing: \nFailed S&S, Dobhoff in place for trial of tube feeds. \n\n# Right IT femur fracture: \nAs detailed above, patient underwent OR fixation on ___.  \nExpired as above. \n\n#PNA: \nCXR on ___ showing possible RLL opacity, cannot exclude PNA. \nLikely CAP. Howevern, given location and mental status, also \nconcern for possible aspiration pneumonitis vs. PNA. Patient \nafebrile, no leukocytosis, however, did develop increased cough \nand sputum production. Repeat CXR with worsening R. effusion. \nCompleted treatment with levofloxacin. Expired as above. \n\n#CAD s/p PCI: \n#Troponinemia: \nNSTEMI w/ PCI to OM1 in ___. Followed by Dr. ___. \nCurrently stable. Continued ASA, Eliquis, and  atorvastatin. \nAdjustments to metoprolol as detailed above. Patient was noted \nto have troponemia without ECG changes attributed to demand \nischemia in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR. \n\n#CKD: \nBaseline Cr 1.3-1.5. Remained at baseline throughout admission. \n\n#HTN: \nBP stable in the 130s-150s/60s-70s throughout admission. \nContinued metoprolol and ISDN. \n\n#HLD: \nContinued atorvastatin.\n\n#RA: Diagnosed in ___ and main joints involved were bilateral \nhands/wrists, occasional toes/ankles/knees. He had been treated \nwith Gold, high dose ASA, plaquenil in the past. Now on \nprednisone, which was continued at home dosing during his \nhospitalization. No concern for adrenal insufficiency requiring \nincreased stress dose steroids. \n \nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=================\n- Medication changes: switched to metop tartrate 37.5mg q6h. \n- discharged on tube feeds via dobhoff; If no significant \nimprovement in mental status over next few weeks, patient and \nfamily will need to revisit overall goals of care. \n- will require frequent suctioning and chest physical therapy \nfor ongoing management of secretions.\n- requiring intermittent straight cath for urinary retention; \ncontinue to bladder scan and monitor PVR. \n- intermittently required diuresis for iatrogenic volume \noverload; discharge weight: ___________*****. \n# Emergency contact: ___  ___, \n___ \n# Code: DNR/DNI\n\nDied with two daughters at bedside on ___. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nApixaban 2.5 mg PO BID  \nAtorvastatin 40 mg PO QPM  \nIsosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 30 mg PO DAILY  \nMetoprolol Succinate XL 50 mg PO DAILY  \nNitroglycerin SL 0.3 mg SL Q5MIN:PRN chest pain Duration: 3 \nDoses  \nPredniSONE 2.5 mg PO DAILY  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.
