Myocardial strain was not measured on prior study and \ntherefore could not be compared.\n\n___ Hip XR\nFINDINGS: \nThe available images show steps related to percutaneous fixation \nof a\nminimally displaced subcapital femoral fracture.  3 cannulated \nscrews are\nplaced across the femoral neck fracture.  Please see the \noperative report for\nfurther details.\n\n- ___ CT Chest without contrast\nIMPRESSION: \n1.  Bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe segmental \nbronchial obstruction\nat the level of the right hilum, likely due to mucous impaction \nor aspiration\nwith right lower lobe ground-glass and consolidation likely \nrepresenting\npostobstructive pneumonia or aspiration with associated \natelectasis.  An\nunderlying mass lesion cannot be excluded and a three-month \ninterval follow-up\nis recommended to assess for resolution.\n2.  Small left and moderate right pleural effusions are \nsignificantly\nincreased from ___.\n3.  Moderate to severe centrilobular emphysema, unchanged.\n4.  Enlargement of the right main pulmonary artery, can be seen \nin the setting\nof pulmonary hypertension, unchanged.\n \n___ CXR\nFINDINGS: \nThere is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Unchanged bilateral \npleural\neffusions and unchanged opacities at the right lung base.  No \npneumothorax. \nThe size and appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is \nunchanged.\nIMPRESSION: \nNo significant interval change since the prior chest radiograph. \n No evidence\nof pulmonary edema.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPATIENT SUMMARY\n=====================\n___ year old woman with history of end-stage COPD/emphysema, AF \non apixaban, CVA, PVD who presented with COPD exacerbation and L \nfemur fracture now s/p closed reduction and percutaneous \nfixation with pinning. She went ot the MICU twice for worsening \ndyspnea requiring BIPAP, though on second trip ___, she did \nnot tolerate BiPAP as it precipitated worsening respiratory \nalkalosis. She returned to the floor with allowance of mild \npermissive hypercapnea. Intermittently diuresed for respiratory \noptimization leading to restart of daily PO diuretic ___. She \ncontinued to have intermittent mucous plugging which cleared \nwith coughing, though cough was somewhat weak. She transitioned \nto DNR/DNI for her end-stage COPD. Goals of care discussions \nwith patient and family moved toward decision for short term \nrehab with symptom management. They are interested in pursuing \nhospice if she does not do well at rehab, and are aware of \nresources. Palliative care assisted with symptom management \nplans and advising around hospice resources. She was discharged \nto rehab with a new do not hospitalize MOLST, and increased COPD \nmanagement and symptom management regimen.\n\nACUTE ISSUES \n===============\n# COPD\n# HAP \n# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure\nPatient admitted with acute dyspnea and hypoxemia and began \ntreatment for COPD exacerbation with azithromycin, steroids, and \nduonebs. She had worsening tachypnea and hypoxic respiratory \nfailure, and was briefly transferred to the ICU for BIPAP and \nescalation of her antibiotic therapy, with brisk resolution of \nher symptoms. She completed 5 day treatment with steroids and \nazithromycin, and was continued on ceftaz to complete a 7 day \ncourse with antibiotics through ___. She unfortunately \ntriggered for tachypnea and hypercarbia on the floor requiring \ntransfer to the ICU for consideration of BiPAP, which was \nultimately deemed to prevent permissive hypercarbia and increase \nher work of breathing and was therefore deferred. She was \nmaintained on albuterol nebs q4h PRN and ipratropium bromide \nnebs q6hr. O2 requirement was weaned to 0L, but intermittently \nwould be on up to 5L for comfort on discharge. Volume and mucous \nplugging were recurrent challenges. She was diuresed with 40mg \nLasix and discharged on maintenance dose of PO Lasix 20mg daily. \nHer home advair was continued, but home Spiriva was held while \ngetting standing ipratropium nebs. Azithromycin every other day \nwas added. Budesonide was started and umeclidium-vilanterol was \nstarted on d/c. \n[] Please follow-up with pulmonology on ___\n\n# Symptom management\nPalliative care was involved to assist in symptomatic \nmanagement. Medications were consolidated to essential \nmedications only. Aggressive bowel regimen was started. For air \nhunger the patient was started on 2mg liquid morphine q4h PRN. \nThis can be titrated as appropriate. \n[] Monitor symptoms of air hunger and up-titrate liquid morphine \nas needed. \n\n# L femoral neck fracture s/p closed reduction and percutaneous \npinning \nPatient endorsed hip pain on admission, XR and CT revealed \nsubacute/acute left femoral neck fracture. Patient underwent \nclosed reduction and percutaneous pinning on ___. She was \nbridged perioperatively with heparin, but apixaban was restarted \non post op day 0. Pain was controlled with Tylenol. Patient was \nevaluated by ___, who recommended rehab post discharge.\n\n# ___ \nPatient with brief elevation in Cr to 1.3 post surgery. Improved \nafter giving fluids.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Atrial fibrillation\nChads-Vasc 6. Her metoprolol was fractionated during \nhospitalization, and consolidated just prior to discharge. Home \napixaban was initially held for surgery and restarted on post-op \nday 0.\n\n# HFrEF- non-ischemic cardiomyopathy\n# Mild MR\n___ this admission with EF 55% but suggestive of non-ischemic \ncardiomyopathic process, moderate pulmonary systolic arterial \nhypertension, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Patient \nwas continued on beta-blocker as above, and home diuretic was \nresumed. Diuretic was uptitrated near discharge per pulmonary \nrecommendations as she was requiring more diuresis for \neuvolemia.\n\n# Iron deficiency anemia.\nShe was given 4 days of IV iron.\n\n# Hypertension\nContinued home metoprolol as above. \n\n# Constipation\nProvided Senna, miralax, bisacodyl.\n\n# Osteopenia\nPatient was continued on home Vitamin D until direction focused \nto reducing pill burden at end of admission.\n\n# Glaucoma\nPatient was continued on home latanoprost, Azopt 1% Ophth, \nDorzolamide 2% Ophth\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n======================\nPULMONARY MEDICATION REGIMEN: \n-- Nebulized budesonide QD \n-- Anoro Ellipta \n-- Duonebs q4h PRN \n-- Azithromycin QOD \n-- Prednisone 10mg daily, to be continued until pulmonary \nfollow-up\n[] Please ensure aggressive airway clearance with chest ___ and \nacapella, mucinex, and aspiration precautions\n[] Please assess volume status and symptoms of dyspnea daily if \nworsening, increase Lasix to 40mg BID for diuresis \n[] Repeat chem 10 in 1 week ___ \n[] follow-up with pulmonology on ___\n[] Monitor symptoms of air hunger and up-titrate liquid morphine \nas needed. \n\n# CODE: DNR/DNI DNH\n# CONTACT: ___ (son) ___ \n\nThis patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain \nmedication at the time of discharge (please see the attached \nmedication list for details). As part of our safe opioid \nprescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid \nrisks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to \ndiscuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to \ndetermine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.\n\n>30 minutes were spent in discharge planning and coordination of \ncare on the day of discharge\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
