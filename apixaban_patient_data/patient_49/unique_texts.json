Now s/p ERCP with removal of sludge; found to have narrowing of CBD now s/p brushings and stent. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # Abdominal Pain # Biliary Obstruction # Cholelithiasis S/p successful ERCP () with sphincterotomy and extraction of a small amount of sludge. Distal CBD possible filling defect noted s/p brushings and stent. Brushings were negative for malignant cells. Plan for EUS and ERCP in 4 weeks for stent pull and further eval (for CBD narrowing). His home apixaban was resumed on . #?CHF His home carvedilol and Lasix were resumed on discharge. # Thrombocytopenia resolved (likely plt count of 61 was erroneous; HIT panel cancelled) # Metabolic acidosis resolved -? to IVF hydration # Daily alcohol use No history of withdrawal.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory Independent. Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. , You were admitted to because of concern for a gallstone that was obstructing your common bile duct. You had an ERCP procedure to clear the common bile duct. They cleared out bile sludge. They found that after they removed the sludge, there was still narrowing of the common bile duct. They took samples of cells in the bile duct and put in a stent to keep the duct open. In 4 weeks, you will need to return for a procedure to remove the stent and to look at the surrounding area with an ultrasound. The pathology from the cells taken from the common bile duct should result in about 1 week. You should receive a phone call from the gastroenterologists with those results. You should continue to take your other medications as you had been taking them. You should refrain from alcohol use for at least a week, if not longer. Your liver function tests are not yet normal, but they are improved. You were also found to have a urinary tract infection. You should take the antibiotic as directed (end date will be . Best wishes for your continued healing. Take care, Your Care Team Followup Instructions:"
