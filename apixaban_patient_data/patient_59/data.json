She was started on Valtrex and \noral\nsteroids elixir on ___. On ___, she began experiencing\ncongestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and cough. She was still\nfeeling unwell two days later, prompting presentation to the ED.\nShe denied fever, chills, chest pain, SOB, or sick contacts.\n\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were T 98.3, HR 70, BP 97/41, RR\n22, and O2 sat 87% on RA. She triggered for hypoxia and was\nplaced on NC and given duonebs, with subsequent improvement in\noxygen saturation. Exam notable for inability to speak in full\nsentences on nasal cannula. Lungs with rhonchi and wheezes\ndiffusely. Labs were notable for leukocytosis to 13.6 with 83.7%\nneutrophils, Na 133, Cr 1.5, lactate 1.5. Flu A/B PCR negative.\nBlood cultures were sent. CXR demonstrated mildly patchy\npneumonia in each lower lobe. The patient was given duonebs, 1L\nLR, azithromycin 500mg PO and ceftriaxone 1g IV. \n\nVitals prior to transfer were T 98.3, HR 74, BP 110/30, RR 14, \nO2\nsat 92% on RA. On arrival to the floor, patient confirms the\nabove story, but does note that symptoms began about 1 week ago.\nShe endorses sore throat, nonproductive cough, congestion, \nnausea\nand vomiting. She also reports diarrhea, at most about 4 times\nper day, with last episode the day prior to presentation. She\ndenies blood in diarrhea. She denies fevers. She reports the \ncold\nsore on her lip has resolved and she thinks the lesions under \nher\ntongue have resolved as well. She finished the dexamethasone \noral\nelixir but still had 2 days of Valtrex left. She feels her\nbreathing is comfortable on nasal cannula, but denies having \nhome\noxygen.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n==================\nPer HPI, otherwise, 10-point review of systems was within normal\nlimits.\n \nPast Medical History:\nAS s/p TAVR (___)\nBreast ca s/p lumpectomy and adjuvant chemoradiation (___)\nHigh grade AV block s/p PPM ___, ___ single chamber \nCAD (on cath) \nHLD\nHTN\nDepression\nHyperplastic colon polyps\nBasal cell carcinoma\nHIT\nOsteoporosis \nShingles \n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nMother- heart disease\nFather- duodenal ulcer\nSister- breast cancer\nBrother- depression, renal cancer \n \nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:\n======================\nVITALS: reviewed in eflowsheets  \nGENERAL: Alert and interactive.

No thrombus/mass is seen \nin the body of the left atrium (best excluded by TEE). There is \nmild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity \nsize. There is normal regional and global left ventricular \nsystolic function. Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular \nejection fraction is 66 % (normal 54-73%). Left ventricular \ncardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting \nleft ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right \nventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid \nannular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic \nsinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta \ndiameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a \nnormal descending aorta diameter. An Evolut aortic valve \nbioprosthesis is present. The prosthesis is well seated with \nnormal leaflet motion and gradient. The effective orifice area \nindex is normal (>=0.85 cm2/m2). There is no aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally \nnormal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral \nannular calcification. There is minimal functional mitral \nstenosis from the prominent mitral annular calcification. There \nis an eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate \n[___] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the \nseverity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The \npulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve \nleaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] \ntricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity \nof tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. There is mild \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Well seated, normal functioning Evolut TAVR with \nnormal gradient and no aortic regurgitation. Mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/ \nglobal biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. Eccentric jet of mild-moderate mitral \nregurgitation with normal valve morphology. Minimal functional \nmitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification. Compared \nwith the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , minimal \nfunctional mitral stenosis is now demonstrated.\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on the echocardiographic findings \nand ___ ACC/AHA\nrecommendations, antibiotic prophylaxis IS recommended prior to \ndental cleanings and other non-sterile\nprocedures.\n  \n___ (PA & LAT)\n\nIMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation compatible with \npneumonia, similar to slightly increased from prior.  Stable \nsmall left pleural effusion.\n \n___ (PORTABLE AP)\nIMPRESSION: \nLungs are low volume with bibasilar atelectasis.  The left \npleural effusion is\nincreased in volume.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is the tube.  \nLeft-sided\npacemaker is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.\n\n     \n___ (PA & LAT)\nIMPRESSION: Findings suggest mild patchy pneumonia in each lower \nlobe.\n\nMICROBIOLOGY:\n=============\n___ 8:41 am BLOOD CULTURE      #2. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. \n__________________________________________________________\n___ 8:18 am BLOOD CULTURE\n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. \n__________________________________________________________\n___ 6:50 pm BLOOD CULTURE      2 OF 2. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___: \n      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE. \n         Isolated from only one set in the previous five days. \n         SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST.. \n\n   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final ___: \n      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS. \n      Reported to and read back by ___ AT \n___ ON\n      ___. \n__________________________________________________________\n___ 6:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE\n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n==================\n[] Discharge weight: 120.8 lbs \n[] Discharge Cr: 0.8\n\n[] Started reduced dose apixaban for pAF given age and weight\n[] Started metoprolol for pAF\n[] Pacemaker should be able to evaluate burden of Afib, \npreviously mentioned in Pacemaker evaluation on ___\n[] Please continue evaluate duration of anticoagulation \n[] For CAP completed 5 d course of azithro and 7d course of CTX\n[] Required NC, but was discharged home without O2 \n[] Discharged with home ___\n[] Based on the echocardiographic findings and ___ ACC/AHA \nrecommendations, antibiotic prophylaxis IS recommended prior to \ndental cleanings and other non-sterile procedures.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n====================\n___ with PMH of AS s/p TAVR (___), AV block s/p PPM, CAD on \nASA, and remote breast adenocarcinoma s/p lumpectomy and \nadjuvant chemoradiation p/w hypoxia and malaise c/f pneumonia \nimproving with IV abx course c/b with neck tightness and pAfib \nwith rapid rates to 150s. \n\nACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:\n====================\n#paroxysmal Afib\nHad Afib with rapid rated to 150, BP was soft ___. 1L IVF \nwas given as well as metop 5IV x2 then PO was started.
