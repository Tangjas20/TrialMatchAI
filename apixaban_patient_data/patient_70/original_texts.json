You were admitted to the hospital with \nshortness of breath, wheezing and cough that we think were most \nlikely caused by bronchitis, possibly from a viral infection.  \nYou improved with conservative treatment including nebulizers, \ncough medicines, and a short course of steroids.  Your blood \nsugars were elevated because of the steroids, but they will go \nback to normal once you complete the course of steroids \n(prednisone).\n\nWe also found that you have evidence of increased fluid in your \nlungs and ankles from your heart failure, so we re-started a \nmedication you had been on previously (called Torsemide) at a \nlower dose than you had previously been on, and we are stopping \nyour hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nYou should weigh yourself every day at home.  Call your doctor \nif your weight goes up or down by more than 3 pounds in a day or \nby more than 5 pounds in a week - this may indicate that we need \nto change the dose of your Torsemide.\n\nIt was a pleasure caring for you and we wish you a full and \nspeedy recovery!\n\nSincerely, \nThe ___ Medicine Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"
