  "18539377-DS-24": "MEDICINE Allergies: Vasotec / Amoxicillin Attending: . Chief Complaint: Cough, wheeze Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: Ms. is a female with history of Atrial Fibrillation on Eliquis, Sick Sinus Syndrome status post Permanent Pacemaker, Chronic Kidney Disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus recently started on insulin who presents with cough, wheezing and sore throat. Her symptoms started a couple of days ago with cough that is occasionally productive, rhinorrhea, sore throat and wheezing. She denies any fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or dysuria. She has occasional chest and abdominal pain when she coughs. She says she notices the wheezing but she does not feel that she is short of breath or that she is having difficulty getting enough air in, except maybe on exertion. The wheezing has been getting progressively worse and her daughter noticed it was loud when talking to her on the phone so went to today for evaluation. She was sent in to the ED due to concern for stridor. On review of outpatient notes, looks like her home torsemide has been held since in the setting of worsening renal function and no evidence of hypervolemia on exam. History from patient tonight isn't great, but there are phone notes from visiting nurse yesterday stating that patient has had a new cough productive of clear phlegm, new wheezing and Tmax of 99 at home. This was associated with new complaints of decreased appetite, weakness and dizziness. (All of which, notably, patient denies to me tonight). In the ED: -VS: afebrile, P 70-80, BP 160-180's, 88% on RA > 96-98% on 2L NC -PExam: Pulm diffusely ronchorous with expiratory wheezes. Inspiratory and expiratory wheeze appreciated when listening over trachea. Ext pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities -Labs: VBG 7.34/47 CBC stable, Cr 1.4 (b/l), Na 125, Cl 88, K hem, gluc 158 FluA/B PCR negative -Imaging: Neck x-ray no evidence of epiglottitis, airway appears patent. CXR with stable cardiomegaly and pulm vasc congestion, mild bibasilar atelectasis but no acute infiltrate. -Interventions: duonebs x2, dexamethasone 10mg IV x1, 1L NS -Course: wheezing improved with duonebs so they held off on CT neck On arrival to the floor patient was without acute complaints. She stated \"I have a cold\" but denied feeling short of breath at present. She also denied chest pain, palpitations or dizziness. She also denies orthopnea or PND but does report slight worsening of her leg swelling over the past few days. ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI. All other systems were reviewed and are negative.

Mild atelectasis in the lung bases without pneumonia.\" CT soft-tissue neck: \"No evidence for epiglottitis. Airway appears patent throughout.\" CXR: IMPRESSION: A left chest wall dual lead pacemaker is present. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar opacities are nonspecific but likely reflect atelectasis. Superimposed aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in the proper clinical context. The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. No evidence of pulmonary edema. AXR: FINDINGS: There are gas-filled loops of small bowel. There is a moderate stool burden within the rectum. There is no free intraperitoneal air. Osseous structures are unremarkable. Two cardiac pacing leads are seen in the lower thorax. There is moderate cardiomegaly. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. Multiple vascular calcifications are noted, most prominently within the bilateral deep and superficial femoral arteries. IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Moderate stool burden.

Her presentation was felt to be most consistent with viral bronchitis +/ reactive airway disease. She was treated with prednisone and her symptoms improved. She was also re-started on torsemide 10 mg PO QD, which she tolerated well. Overall picture seems consistent with a viral bronchitis overlaid upon a chronic HFpEF with possible chronic/subacute worsening of volume status. evaluated her and recommended home with outpatient , and when she was symptomatically improved, she was discharged home. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [ ] Patient to perform daily standing weights at home [ ] Needs outpatient Cardiology f/u in weeks for further eval/mgmt of HFpEF and titration of torsemide dose. [ ] We stopped her home HCTZ on admission given hyponatremia and normotension, this was not resumed at discharge. [ ] Patient should have a repeat electrolyte panel done at her next PCP visit to ensure she is tolerating resumption of torsemide without electrolyte abnormalities or renal dysfunction. [ ] Patient prescribed an albuterol-ipratropium inhaler PRN at discharge in case she develops wheezing in the future.

Do not restart Hydrochlorothiazide until PCP Discharge : Home With Service Facility: Discharge Diagnosis: # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure # Dyspnea on Exertion # Reactive airway disease / possibly viral bronchitis # Congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction # Hyponatremia # Chronic kidney disease # Diabetes mellitus and steroid-induced hyperglycemia Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). Discharge Instructions: Mrs. , was our pleasure caring for you at . You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath, wheezing and cough that we think were most likely caused by bronchitis, possibly from a viral infection. You improved with conservative treatment including nebulizers, cough medicines, and a short course of steroids. Your blood sugars were elevated because of the steroids, but they will go back to normal once you complete the course of steroids (prednisone). We also found that you have evidence of increased fluid in your lungs and ankles from your heart failure, so we re-started a medication you had been on previously (called Torsemide) at a lower dose than you had previously been on, and we are stopping your hydrochlorothiazide. You should weigh yourself every day at home. Call your doctor if your weight goes up or down by more than 3 pounds in a day or by more than 5 pounds in a week this may indicate that we need to change the dose of your Torsemide. It was a pleasure caring for you and we wish you a full and speedy recovery! Sincerely, The Medicine Team Followup Instructions:"
