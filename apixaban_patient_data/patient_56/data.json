On ___, she found him to be confused and dysarthric\nand had a brain MRI per his neurologist's recommendation. The \nMRI\nwas negative for acute intracranial process. Then, the morning \nof\npresentation around 10AM his daughter was taking him to his PCP\nappointment when she noted him to be dysarthric and confused. At\nhis PCP appointment, he stated he felt he was going to die, with\ngeneralized pain and weakness.\n\nHis PCP sent him to the ED given for evaluation for possible TIA\nand management of his hyperglycemia.\n\nIn the ED, initial vitals were: T 95.6 BP 125/85 HR 101 RR 16\nSpO2 99% RA\n\nExam notable for:\nAt 12:30PM, he was alert and oriented with non-slurred speech.\n\nLabs notable for:\n- blood glucose 412\n- HbA1C 13.5\n- negative Utox\n- lactate 2.3\n- Na 132\n\nStudies notable for:\nNCHCT: \n1.

They felt his symptoms were\nrelated to hyperglycemia causing recrudescence vs being off his\napixaban (held due to tooth extraction recently).\n\nPer case management he is not yet ready for SNF placement, so\nrecommended admission to medicine.\n\nOn arrival to the floor, he reports feeling overall well. He\nstates he is having no current confusion and denies any\ndifficulty speaking currently. He notes that occasionally he\ndevelops confusion at home, but that it quickly resolves. He\ntakes his 78U glargine at bedtime and does not take short acting\ninsulin at home. He checks his blood glucose very rarely (less\nthan once per week) and does not know the range.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nPer HPI, otherwise, 10-point review of systems was within normal\nlimits.\n \nPast Medical History:\n1.
