On ___, she found him to be confused and dysarthric\nand had a brain MRI per his neurologist's recommendation. The \nMRI\nwas negative for acute intracranial process. Then, the morning \nof\npresentation around 10AM his daughter was taking him to his PCP\nappointment when she noted him to be dysarthric and confused. At\nhis PCP appointment, he stated he felt he was going to die, with\ngeneralized pain and weakness.\n\nHis PCP sent him to the ED given for evaluation for possible TIA\nand management of his hyperglycemia.\n\nIn the ED, initial vitals were: T 95.6 BP 125/85 HR 101 RR 16\nSpO2 99% RA\n\nExam notable for:\nAt 12:30PM, he was alert and oriented with non-slurred speech.\n\nLabs notable for:\n- blood glucose 412\n- HbA1C 13.5\n- negative Utox\n- lactate 2.3\n- Na 132\n\nStudies notable for:\nNCHCT: \n1.
