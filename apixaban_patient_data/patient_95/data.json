Initially \nthere was concern for meningitis given fever and neck pain, \nhowever, patient without meningeal signs and refused LP. CTA \nchest was done which showed multiple subsegmental PEs in setting \nof being off anticoagulation since ___ and s/p IVC \nfilter. Patient remained hemodynamically stable and started on \nApixaban for anticoagulation.\n\n#FALL: \nHas had frequent falls at rehab. All appear to be mechanical. No \nhistory of loss of consciousness but patient may not be a good \nhistorian. Has small pulmonary emboli which could have caused \nsyncope but they are reportedly smaller PEs which make it less \nlikely. She did not appear hypovolemic or to have had a seizure \nbased on history. Trop were negative making cardiac ischemia \nunlikely. Held off on TTE as there was no evidence of murmur on \nexam. \n\n#SUBSEGMENTAL, SUBMASSIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM: History of right \nlower extremity DVT s/p IVC filter. Discontinued Eliquis in the \n___ due to concern for bleeding in setting of multiple \nfalls. Off anticoagulation, presented w/ multiple subsegmental \nPEs. Trop negative and BNP only mildly elevated. LENIs without \nevidence of DVTs. Vascular medicine consulted regarding \nanticoagulation management and felt that benefit of \nanticoagulation in prevention of further PE greatly outweighs \nrisk of ICH from falls. Unclear why IVC filter was placed on \n___ but could certainly be propagating clots. Recommend \nremoval of IVC filter in ___ months post discharge\n\n#FEVER: No signs of pneumonia, UTI. Has neck pain but no signs \nof\nmeningitis on exam and she refused LP. Pain felt likely due to \nneck strain. She reportedly has evidence of diverticulosis on CT \nat OSH and was briefly treated with cipro/flagyl. Flu swab was \nnegative and blood cultures so far showing no growth. Patient \nremained afebrile while hostpitalized. Suspect fever may have \nbeen due to PE. Discharged off antibiotics.\n\n#WEIGHT LOSS: History of significant weight loss per patient \nover ___ year\nperiod due to eating less. No early satiety, nausea, but has had \ndecreased appetite. Patient appears otherwise AAOX3 and \nindependent, which makes malignancy or systemic illness as cause \nof anorexia more concerning.\n\n#NECK PAIN: most likely muscle strain but as above could be due\nto meningitis in setting of fever. LP refused. Symptoms improved\nwith pain management as below. Treated symptoms with lidocaine \npatch, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and cyclobenzaprine with improvement \nin neck pain.\n\n#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Continued propafenone. Apixaban was \nstopped in ___ due to multiple falls at home and risk of \nICH. Consulted vascular medicine while hospitalized who felt \nbenefit of preventing future PE and embolic stroke far \noutweighed risks of ICH from falls stating \"Her CHADS-Vasc score \nis 3 (female, age) and her HASBLED score is 1 (Age). \nFurthermore, it is estimated in 1 model that a patient would \nhave to fall 295 times in a year to average 1 ICH, the most\ndangerous risk of A/C in patients who fall ___ M, \n___ G, ___ A, Laupacis A. Choosing antithrombotic therapy for \nelderly patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for \nfalls. Arch Intern Med. ___ This risk is \nlikely even lower with DoACs whose rate of ICH was lower than \nwarfarin in trials. Therefore we would advocate continuing dose \nreduced Eliquis for Ms. ___ and interventions per the \nprimary team for lifestyle and behavioral modifications to \nreduce falls.\" Patient was restarted on low dose apixaban.\n\n#ANEMIA: normocytic anemia, stable from baseline\n\n#HHYPOTHYROIDISM:\ncontinued levothyroxine 88 mcg\n\n#DEPRESSION: continue escitalopram 20 mg daily\n\n#ARTHRITIS: ibuprofen and tylenol as needed\n\n===================\nMedication Changes\n===================\n- Started Apixaban 2.5mg BID\n- Started Cyclobenzaprine TID:PRN neck pain (Please discontinue \nonce neck pain improved)\n- Started lidocaine patch QAM:PRN neck pain (Please discontinue \nonce neck pain improved)\n- Started multivitamin w/ minerals daily\n\n===================\nTransitional Issues\n===================\n[ ] History of multiple PE s/p IVC filter and on apixaban: \nPatient started on low dose apixaban during admission for a fib \nand history of PE. Unclear why IVC filter was placed and should \nbe removed in 1 to 2 months post discharge.\n\n[ ] Weight loss: Patient endorsed significant weight loss per \npatient over ___ year period due to eating less. Concern for \nmalignancy as patient is otherwise functional. Please consider \nage appropriate cancer screening as outpatient if within \npatient's goals of care\n\n[ ] History of falls: Likely mechanical falls based on history. \nPatient will be discharged to rehab but should have outpatient \nevaluation of lifestyle and behavioral modifications to reduce \nfalls at nursing facility.\n\n[ ] Anemia: Patient presented with anemia with normocytic anemia \nwithout evidence of acute bleeding. Given weight loss as \ndescribed above, please consider further workup for GI \nmalignancy if within patient's goals of care\n\n# CODE: DNR/DNI per patient\n# CONTACT: ___ \n Relationship: SON \n Phone: ___ \n \n___ on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.
