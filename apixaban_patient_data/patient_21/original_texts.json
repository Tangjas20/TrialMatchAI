The patient \nshares that over the past week or so he has had two falls. The \nday of presentation he fell and hit his right knee, and this is \nwhat caused presentation to the ED. He does not think he has \never hit his head. He says he believes he did have dialysis \ntoday, and per chart review he develops orthostatic hypotension \npost dialysis. The patient uses a walker to walk, and said his \nfalls occurred after standing up and taking a few steps. He said \nhe does not think he felt lightheaded, but cannot remember. He \ndoes not think he has been confused. He has had no recent fevers \nor chills, no headaches, palpitations or chest pain, no dyspnea, \nno poor oral intake or increased GI or GU output.  \n In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6 38 (up to 78) 86/31 (up to \n108/60) RR 18 O2 99 RA.

Pseudogout: On presentation \nto the ED the patient's knee was erythematous, very swollen and \nexquisitely tender to the touch, with limited range of motion. \nOne dose of vancomycin in the ED was able to make a dramatic \ndifference in appearance, as well as significant improvement of \nleukocytosis, strongly suggesting that there is an infectious \netiology underlying this presentation. X-ray of knee was \nnegative for fracture. A small effusion was tapped by the \nOrthopedics team and sent for culture. While cultures have not \ngrown anything to date (likely secondary to receiving vancomycin \nbefore tapping), they were significant for ___ WBC, 89% PMNs \nand rhomboid calcium pyrophosphate crystals. It was decided to \ntreat empirically for GPC joint infection with vancomycin (HD \ndosing) for 14 days and then transition him to po Bactrim. In \naddition, he was still complaining of pain with passive motion \nin his knee so it was decided to do colchicine for one dose.\n\n#Falls, presyncope: The etiology of the patient's falls was not \nfully clarified, but it was considered multifactorial, including \npersistent hypotension requiring midodrine use, hypoglycemia in \nthe context of recent start of lantus use, as well as inability \nto bear weight on right. During the hospitalization, the patient \nwas placed on telemetry for monitoring, with no significant \nevents. Because of recent TTE, a repeat was not obtained. \nOrthostatic vitals did not show evidence of orthostatic \nhypotension. Of note, on admission pt had QTc 682, which \nresolved by the next day without intervention. No offending \nmedication were identified. Cause remained unclear.\n\n#odynophagia: noted to be worse on Left, related to eating solid \nfoods but not liquids. The odynophagia did not prevent the \npatient from eating meals but limited how much and caused \ndiscomfort. Patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow, who \nrecommended ENT follow up. Pt will arrange ___ with his \nown outpatient ENT provider.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n\n#Afib:  Patient currently in Afib, rate controlled. Continued \nhome amiodorone and apixaban.\n\n#CAD s/p CABG ___, MVR ___: stable.  \n\n#ESRD on HDL: Had dialysis ___. Renally dosed all \nmedications; continued home sevelamer and nephrocaps.\n\n#HFrEF: Last EF 30% on TTE ___. Patient did not appear volume \noverloaded. There was no indication for repeat TTE.\n\n#Hyperglycemia: Recently started on lantus. Obtained A1c 8.2%. \nContinued home lantus.  \n \n#Hypothyroidism:  continued home synthroid\n\n#GIST: Stable on recent imaging.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[ ] Continue vancomycin for a total of 14 days with hemodialysis \n(___). Continue with Bactrim, 3 double-strength tablets \nthree times a week after hemodialysis for another 14 days \n(___)\n[ ] Follow up with ENT regarding odynophagia\n[ ] Follow up with PCP; PCP to obtain an EKG to re-check QTc\n[ ] ___ on DM.
