BiPAP did not improve \nher blood gas, likely because of minimal settings used, and on \narrival to the MICU the BiPAP was removed and her blood gas did \nnot worsen nor did she have any encephalopathy from the elevated \nCO2. The etiology of her respiratory failure was felt to be \nmulti-factorial including baseline severe COPD with an \nadditional component of likely OSA/OHS superimposed on a heart \nfailure flare that increased work of breathing (ultimately \nincreasing her CO2) and also caused a cardio-renal ___ \n(preventing appropriate metabolic compensation). The plan was to \ndiurese her to a dry weight and then reassess her needs, only \nplacing her on BiPAP for a clinical change. \n\nHer heart failure exacerbation was subacute in nature, with \naround a 30 pound weight gain over the several months since she \nwas last discharged (weight at that time was 196 pounds with a \nSCr of 1.0) that correlated with a gradual worsening of her \nfunctional status. She ultimately required a Lasix drip at \n7.5mg/hr to achieve active diuresis, with improvement in her \ncreatinine and increase in her bicarbonate levels (unclear if \nthis represented a regained ability for metabolic compensation \nfor the respiratory acidosis vs. contraction alkalosis from \naggressive diuresis). \n\nFollowing improvement of oxygenation status, she was \ntransitioned to the floor where diuresis was continued with IV \nLasix boluses. During this time, her O2 requirements ultimately \ndecreased to her home requirements of 2L. She did intermittently \ndevelop a significant contraction alkalosis with bicarb in the \nlow ___ for which diuretics were briefly held pending \nresolution. She was then transitioned to oral torsemide, \ninitially BID then daily. In this setting, she did develop \nanother ___, most likely prerenal, which resolved with more \njudicious diuresis. She will be discharge on torsemide 80mg \ndaily (increased from 60mg daily). \n\n================================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES \n================================\n[]Will need to clarify her day time oxygen requirement and night \ntime positive pressure requirement \n[]Discharge weight/dry weight: 206 lb\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
