Severely enlarged cardiac silhouette, unchanged since \n___.  \nPrevious mild pulmonary edema has resolved. \n2. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. \n\n___ Imaging UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS \nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower \nextremity veins.\n\n___ Cardiovascular Transthoracic Echo Report \nThe left atrial volume index is moderately increased. No \nthrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium (best \nexcluded by TEE). The right atrium is mildly enlarged. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is\n___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy \nwith a normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global \nleft ventricular systolic function. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is\nlow normal. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection \nfraction is >=55%. Left ventricular cardiac index is low normal \n(2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow \ntract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal \nfree wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender \nwith a normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic \narch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. \nThe aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally \nnormal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate mitral \nannular calcification. There\nis mild to moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic \nshadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be \nUNDERestimated. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. \nThe tricuspid\nvalve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild to \nmoderate [___] tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild-moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \neffusion.\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nnormal cavity size and regional/ global biventricular systolic \nfunction. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation with normal valve \nmorphology. Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate \npulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension.\n\nCompared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , \nthe findings are similar (rhythm is now atrial fibrillation; \nleft ventricular hypertrophy and mild-moderate mitral \nregurgitation were present\non review of the prior study).\n\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n\n___ 07:17AM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-4.29 Hgb-12.5 Hct-38.5 MCV-90 \nMCH-29.1 MCHC-32.5 RDW-13.7 RDWSD-45.1 Plt ___\n___ 07:17AM BLOOD Glucose-92 UreaN-23* Creat-1.2* Na-141 \nK-4.0 Cl-103 HCO3-23 AnGap-___ female history of HFpEF, A. fib, hypertension, CKD \nstage III, and dementia presented to ___ with a cough and \nweakness for a few days, transferred for management of PNA and \nfluid overload.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n#pneumonia: \nPresented with several days of cough, streaky right basilar \nopacities on CXR, and fever to 102. She received \nvancomycin/Zosyn ___ then vancomycin/cefepime/azithro but was \ntransitioned to ultimately cefpodixime/azithro for a 5 day \ncourse.  MRSA, urine legionella, strep negative.\n\n#persistent cough:\nLikely from resolving pneumonia. Concern for volume overload as \nbelow but she did not tolerate diuretics. She was started on \nguaifenesin and nebs.\n\n#Acute on chronic HFpEF:\nPatient presented with elevated pro-BNP (prior ___), ___ edema \nand new O2 requirement. Received IV Lasix boluses while \ninpatient. Repeat TTE unchanged from prior (mild to moderate MR, \nmild to mod TR, normal EF). ___ negative for DVT. No e/o \nischemia on EKG. She was given intermittent diuretics which led \nto acute kidney injury so held on discharge. She was not on \ndiuretics pre-admission. If persistently volume overloaded, a \nrhythm control strategy may be warranted as the patient may not \nbe able to tolerate atrial fibrillation. \n\n#Atrial fibrillation with Rates to 130s: \nTrigger most likely following nebulizers and possibly iso fluid \noverload. Prior admission at ___ ___ for afib with RVR \nand converted spontaneously and she was discharged on atenolol \n12.5m PO daily and apixaban 5mg PO BID. However, apixaban had \nbeen discontinued and she has not been on any anticoagulation \nfor months.  During current admission, TSH normal. CHADS2 of 3, \nso started on apixaban 5mg PO BID. She had difficult to control \nheart rates with tachycardia then bradycardia. She was \nultimately discharged on metoprolol XL 200mg daily and diltiazem \nER 120mg PO. She was stable on this regimen for >48 hours. \n\n#Thrombocytopenia\nNo associated renal injury/anemia/coagulopathy, most likely iso \ninfection. Resolved prior to discharge. \n\n#Hypothyrodism\nTSH, T3 normal, T4 slightly low \n-continued levothyroxine\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#CKD stage III\nAt normal baseline ~1.2\n-avoided nephrotoxic agents\n-renally dosed meds \n\n#HTN\n-continued home lisinopril\n-held home atenolol and started metoprolol as above  \n\n#Dementia\n-continued home donepezil \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=====================\n[ ] monitor Na and creatinine off of diuretics \n[ ] monitor volume status off diuretics, consideration of rhythm \ncontrol if cannot control volume \n[ ] discharge weight: 164 lb\n[ ] discharge creatinine: 1.2\n[ ] discharge diuretic: none\n[ ] monitor heart rates to ensure patient not \ntachycardic/bradycardic on current regimen, consideration of \npacemaker/cardiology referral for sick sinus syndrome \n[ ] continue to discuss risks/benefits of anticoagulation\n[ ] recheck thyroid function tests within ___ weeks to ensure on \nproper levothyroxine dose  \n[ ] hydralazine held on discharge, assess need for \nanti-hypertensives \n[ ] aspirin held on discharge as no clear indication, please \nassess need to restart \n[ ] assess duration of need for duonebs, levalbuterol, and \nguaifenisn \n[ ] repeat CXR in ___ weeks to ensure resolving pneumonia \n#CODE: DNR/DNI confirmed with pts and HCP ___, okay for\nBIPAP\n#CONTACT: ___ daughter and HCP ___\n\n \n___ on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Your heart rates were elevated so \nwe started you on medications to slow them down. We also started \nyou on a blood thinner to help prevent future strokes. We gave \nyou diuretics, medications that make you urinate  but ultimately \nheld them on discharge as your kidneys did not tolerate them. \n\nWHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?\nYou should take your medications as instructed.\nYou should go to your doctors ___ as below.\nPlease weigh yourself daily and call your doctor if your weight \nincreases or decreased by 3 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a \nweek.\n\nWe wish you the best!\n-Your ___ Care Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"
