History is obtained from her son, ___, over the\nphone. He states that he last saw her on ___ (around 5 days\nprior to admission) and she was at her baseline. She is normally\ncoherent, able to have full sentences. Between ___ night \nand\n___ morning she had a significant change. On ___ when she\nwas seen by a new health aid it was noted that she was not\ntalking, not cooperating with her aid, and not getting out of\nbed. There were no known falls or headstrikes, and she had not\nbeen complaining of anything in particular prior to this. When\ntaken to the hospital she was unable to recognize her family\nmembers, though she did intermittently say a few words. \n\nShe was first brought to ___ where she was found to\nhave a temp of 98, HR 74, BP 141/87, RR 18, satting 98% on room\nair. Labs were notable for a normal CBC, and lytes (Cr 1.2), u/a\nwith positive nitrates, moderate leuk esterase, 5 WBCs, many\nbacteria. She was started on ceftriaxone and given a full dose\naspirin (unclear reason). She was transferred to the ED at ___\nfor \"UTI with metabolic encephalopathy\". (Of note, her family \nhad\nrequested that she be transferred to ___, where she had\nbeen seen previously.)\n\nHer son notes that her right arm is often in an odd position,\nalmost as though she was paralyzed on that side, which he had\nnoticed over the years. It often seems to be tender, and he has\nnoted that she does not use it often.\n\nHer son also notes that she has been taking her evening pills in\nthe morning because she had been falling asleep prior to using\nthem. This includes her pills for insomnia. He states that he \nhas\nnever heard of atrial fibrillation before and is not aware of \nany\ndiagnosis. \n\nHe notes that she previously was on a lot of medications, and\nthat the number has really be cut down over the past few years.\nShe stopped taking several because she was feeling dizzy. He\nbelieves that she may have been on a blood thinner and something\nfor pain. He notes that she doesn't know how to use the \nalbuterol\ninhaler and has no idea what it is for - she does not use this.\nHe is otherwise not sure what she is taking at home. \n\nOn review of records, patient has been hospitalized twice at\n___ in the past ___ years. In ___ she was admitted for\nhypoxic respiratory failure from a heart failure exacerbation.\nShe was diuresed and discharged on Lasix. She was also treated\nfor afib with RVR, which was a new diagnosis at the time. She \nwas\nstarted on apixaban. She was found to have moderate to severe AS\non TTE. Course was also complicated by GPC bacteremia, thought \nto\nbe from cellulitis. \n\nShe was readmitted in ___ again with a heart failure\nexacerbation, requiring ICU admission for BiPAP. During this\nadmission she again was found to have afib with RVR, which\nimproved. However, it was noted that her apixaban had been\nstopped in between the hospitalizations secondary to several\nfalls that she was having. Course was also complicated by\nhospital acquired delirium. \n\nIn the ED:\n\nInitial vital signs were notable for: T 98, HR 83, BP 143/83, RR\n18, 97% RA \n\nExam notable for:\nNeuro: Alert and following commands, moving all extremities\nspontaneously, not cooperating with neurological exam due to\naltered mental status., ANO x1\nPsych: Normal mood/altered mental status\n\nLabs were notable for:\n\n- CBC: WBC 6.0, hgb 12.3, plt 189 \n\n- Lytes:\n\n140 / 99 / 18     AGap=13 \n------------- 109 \n4.4 \\ 28 \\ 1.2 \n\n- LFTs: AST: 21 ALT: 9 AP: 80 Tbili: 0.6 Alb: 4.3 \n- lipase 18\n- lactate 1.7\n- u/a with small leuks, small blood, positive nitrites, 6 WBCs,\nfew bacteria \n\nStudies performed include:\n- CT a/p w/ contrast  -  Mildly thickened urinary bladder wall\nwith subtle fat stranding, consistent with provided history of\nurinary tract infection.

Dilated thoracic aorta and great arteries.\n4. 4 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, recommend follow-up \nper the\n___ criteria as detailed below.\n\nCT Abd/Pelvis:\n1. Mildly thickened urinary bladder wall with subtle fat \nstranding, consistent with provided history of urinary tract \ninfection.  No evidence of renal calculi.\n2. No acute intra-abdominal process.\n3. Moderate to severe aortic valvular calcifications, which may \nbe\nhemodynamically significant.\n4.

Patent circle of ___ without evidence of \nstenosis,occlusion,or aneurysm.\n3. Main then the limitation of poor contrast visualization, \npatent bilateral cervical carotid and vertebral arteries without \nevidence of stenosis, occlusion, or dissection.\n\nMRI Head:\n1. T2 FLAIR hyperintensities demonstrating decreased diffusion \nthe left vertex along the distribution of left anterior cerebral \nartery middle cerebral artery watershed region are suggestive of \nacute infarct.\n2. Multiple other small punctate acute infarcts are seen in the \nleft frontal lobe, basal ganglia and the) right periventricular \nregion regions.  No signs of hemorrhage.\n3. Additional T2 FLAIR hyperintensities in the periventricular \nwhite matter\nthat are suggestive of moderate chronic small vessel ischemic \ndisease.\n4.

Her \nhead CT showed no acute findings, though a chronic infarct was \nseen in the left frontal lobe. CTA head/neck revealed chronic \natherosclerosis and no acute infarct. MRI was obtained which \nthen demonstrated with multiple punctate infarcts in the left \nfrontal lobe, basal ganglia and the right periventricular region \nregions. She was also found to have decreased diffusion the left \nvertex along the distribution of left anterior cerebral artery \nmiddle cerebral artery watershed region are suggestive of acute \ninfarct. Stroke was felt to likely be secondary to embolic \norigin from atrial fibrillation, with a possible component of \nwatershed infarct in the left ACA distribution due to chronic \nsevere carotid disease. Home atorvastatin was increased from \n10mg to 40mg. Home labetalol was stopped to allow for permissive \nhypertension. TTE was somewhat limited though there was no \nobvious vegetation or clot visualized. She was seen by neurology \nwho recommended anticoagulation with a heparin drip. She \nremained stable on heparin and repeat head CT was obtained which \nshowed no evidence of hemorrhage. She was then transitioned to \napixaban 5mg BID. Home aspirin was stopped per neurology \nrecommendations due to increased bleeding of risk on \nanticoagulation.\n\n# UTI: Found to have bladder wall thickening on CT and urine \nculture grew ESBL E coli. Given altered mental status and \ninability to assess for symptoms (in addition to possibility of \nUTI contributing to altered mental status and recrudescence of \nprior L sided stroke symptoms), she was treated with bactrim for \na 10 day course (day 7 = ___, however UA only had 6 WBC and \nfew bacteria so it is possible this was colonization.\n\n# Afib: Not a new diagnosis, and rates currently \nwell-controlled. Not on anticoagulation at home due to previous \nfalls. Labetalol initially was held in the setting of acute \nstroke, then resumed. Rates were well controlled with half of \nhome dose, therefore discharged on 100 mg TID. Started apixaban \nfor anticoagulation as above.\n\n# ___\nMild, BUN overall doubled during this hospitalization, was \ninitially receiving diuretic, then held Lasix and gave small \namount of fluids back. Likely due to decreased PO intake on \nmodified diet. \n\n# Dilated ascending and descending thoracic aorta: incidentally \nseen on imaging, unclear if new finding. Can monitor as an \noutpatient. Continued blood pressure control with labetalol.\n\n# Code status: MOLST signed by patient on ___ confirms \nDNR/DNI. Discussed with HCP ___. He was not previously aware of \nhis mother's wishes to be DNR/DNI. Discussed that given her \nadvanced age and multiple medical comorbidities, the chances of \nher surviving a code with any meaningful quality of life would \nbe very low. Code status was changed to DNR/DNI and updated \nMOLST was filled out while hospitalized, though no changes were \nmade to preferences on prior MOLST form.\n\n# Pulmonary nodules \nFound to have incidental 4mm pulmonary nodule. For incidentally \ndetected multiple solid pulmonary nodules smaller than 6mm, no \nCT follow-up is recommended in a low-risk patient, and an \noptional CT follow-up in 12 months is recommended in a high-risk \npatient. \n\nCHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n# Chronic diastolic heart failure \n# Moderate-severe aortic stenosis \nContinued home Lasix initially, however patient was not eating \nand drinking that well and started to develop a mild ___, \ntherefore this was held. Please resume when possible.\n\n# HLD:\nStopped home aspirin per neurology recommendations due to \nincreased risk of bleeding on anticoagulation. Increased home \natorvastatin from 10mg to 40mg\n\n# Hypertension \nInitially held home labetalol to allow for permissive \nhypertension, then resumed at reduced dose \n\n# Insomnia \nHeld home trazodone due to altered mental status, started \nramelteon, which patient took intermittently. Resumed trazodone \non discharge.\n\n>30 minutes spent discharge planning and coordination on day of \ndischarge.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n====================\n- home aspirin stopped due to increased risk of bleeding on \nanticoagulation\n- started on apixaban 5mg BID for anticoagulation\n- home atorvastatin increased from 10mg to 40mg\n- could consider 12 month follow up CT for incidental pulmonary \nnodule if high risk, though likely not necessary given advanced \nage and functional status\n- on nectar thick liquids and pureed solids, will need continued \nspeech and swallow evaluation with diet advancement if possible \n(family may also elect to advance to regular diet for comfort)\n- labetalol reduced, please monitor heart rates and BP and \ntitrate as needed\n- dilated ascending and descending thoracic aorta incidentally \nseen on imaging, can monitor as an outpatient\n- Code status changed to DNR/DNI, MOLST completed\n- home Lasix on hold, please resume when PO intake improves  \n- repeat TTE routinely; inpatient TTE was limited in assessment \nof severity of aortic stenosis\n- ESBL E coli found in the urine, if needs empiric outpatient \ntreatment for UTI would use Bactrim rather than cipro, macrobid \nas she had resistance to these\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation inhalation Q6H:PRN \nwheezing \n2.

We found that you had unfortunately \nhad several new strokes, likely caused by your atrial \nfibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm).\nYou were seen by the neurologists, who recommended starting a \nblood thinner to prevent any future strokes.\n\nWhile you were here you were also treated for a urinary tract \ninfection with antibiotics.\n\nYou are now going to rehab to work on getting stronger and \nspeaking more.\n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you, and we are happy that \nyou're feeling better!\nYour ___ Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",
