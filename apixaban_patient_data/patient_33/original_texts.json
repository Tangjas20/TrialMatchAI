Smaller right \npleural effusion with mild edema noted. \n\n___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nIMPRESSION:  \nComparison to ___.  The pleural drain on the left is in \nstable \nposition.  The left effusion has substantially decreased in \nextent.  Mild left basilar atelectasis.  A remnant effusion is \nlimited to the left costophrenic sinus.  No pneumothorax.  A \ndecrease in size of the cardiac silhouette. Stable signs of mild \npulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Stable position of the \npacemaker leads. \n\n___ Cardiovascular Transthoracic Echo Report \nIMPRESSION: Globally preserved biventricular systolic function. \nSuboptimal image quality to assess for possible regional \ndysfunction. Mild aortic stenosis. Very small pericardial \neffusion. Left pleural effusion.\n\n___HEST W/O CONTRAST \nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Significant interval improvement of left-sided pleural \neffusion with \nPleurX catheter in place.  A portion of the fluid does appear to \nbe somewhat loculated anteriorly where it measures 11.5 x 5.1 \ncm. \n2.  Mild diffuse pulmonary edema with additional patchy \nbibasilar airspace \nopacities which may represent subsegmental atelectasis, \naspiration, or \ndeveloping pneumonia. \n3.  Stable small right pleural effusion and slight increase in \nsmall \npericardial effusion. \n4.  Stable mild prominence mediastinal lymph nodes presumably \nreactive. \n\n___BD & PELVIS W/O CON   \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Grossly stable left perinephric hematoma measuring 11.2 cm in \nthe setting of renal biopsy. \n2. 2.  Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. \n3. 3.  Additional chronic changes as above. \n\n___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nIMPRESSION:  \nIn comparison with the study ___, the PleurX catheter \nremains in place and there is small residual effusion with \natelectatic changes.  Area of opacification adjacent to the left \nheart border could reflect the anteriorly loculated effusion. \nCardiac silhouette remains enlarged with some increased \nindistinctness of \nengorged pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary \nvenous pressure. Cardiac pacer leads are unchanged. \n\n___BD & PELVIS W/O CON \nSmall pleural effusions have decreased.  A pleural catheter is \nagain present\non the left-side.\nSmall amount of air in the left pleural effusion can be \nanticipated with the\npresence of the drain.\n \n \nHeart is mildly enlarged with coronary and valvular \ncalcifications in addition\nto a dual lead pacemaker/ICD device.\n \nWithin the limitations of a non-contrast examination, no focal \nliver lesions\nof concern are identified, only a subcentimeter hypodense focus \nin the fourth\nsegment which is stable although too small to characterize.  \nThere is no\nbiliary dilatation.  Medium-size calcified stone in the gall \nbladder as\nbefore.  Adrenals, pancreas and spleen are unremarkable.  Small \ncyst in the\ninterpolar right kidney is unchanged.  Larger one again arises \nfrom the lower\npole and also appears simple.  The left kidney is still splayed \nforward by a\nlarge masslike but probably for the most part subcapsular \nhematoma.  Its\nmaximal dimension of 13.3 cm is unchanged.  Mild left-sided \npelviectasis\nappears unchanged.\n \nStomach is unremarkable.  Staple line noted across the lower \nmesentery.  Small\nbowel is unremarkable.  Large bowel appears normal.\n \nMostly empty bladder is difficult to assess.  Seminal vesicles \nappear normal. \nThe prostate is mild to moderately enlarged with central \nhypertrophy.  There\nis no lymph adenopathy.  Vascular calcification is moderate.  \nMusculature is\natrophic.\n \nThere are no suspicious bone lesions.

Prospective end date is ___\n[ ] Warfarin was initiated on ___ as his kidney function at \ndischarge was too poor to restart apixaban. Ensure follow up \nwith his PCP\n[ ] Membranous nephropathy treatment can be re-evaluated by \noutpatient nephrology. Tacrolimus was discontinued due to rising \nCr during admission and other medications deferred because of \nquestionable tolerability\n[ ] Draining pleural fluid from Pleurex every other day. Most \nrecent output was very scant\n[ ] Epo was recommended by renal for anemia due to CKD\n\nACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:\n====================\n#Hypoxic respiratory failure\n#Left pleural effusion\n#Leukocytosis\n#Enterococcus/Enterobacter empyema\nPresented with pain in the chest, pleural fluid was sampled and \nfound to be growing enterococcus and enterobacter. \nInterventional pulmonary and infectious disease were consulted. \nHe was given broad spectrum antibiotics that were narrowed to \nzosyn with a planned course of 4 weeks to complete ___ but \nfinal course to be determined by infectious disease at follow \nup. Infectious disease will arrange OPAT follow up. \nInterventional pulmonary instilled ___ on ___ with high \nvolume of drainage that decreased through the remainder of the \nhospitalization. He is now having drainage every other day. \n\n#Left renal hematoma\n#Perinephric hematoma\nStable per CT Torso. He was initially placed on a heparin drip \nin the setting of his hematoma but was transitioned to warfarin \non ___, as he could not be re-initiated on apixaban due to poor \nrenal function. Repeat CT was performed in the setting of rising \ncreatinine on ___ and showed stable hematoma size.\n\n#CKD ___ membranous nephropathy\n#Acidosis - resolved\n#Hyperkalemia - resolved\nTacrolimus was discontinued in the setting of worsening renal \nfunction. Nephrology was consulted and had a discussion with the \npatient and his family about treatment options. No new therapy \nwas initiated due to questionable tolerability and risk of side \neffects, and they recommended follow up with outpatient \nnephrology.\n\n#AFib\ns/p KCentra for reversal given concern for worsening hematoma\nHome metoprolol was continued. Anticoagulation was \nintermittently on and off in the setting of the subcapsular \nbleed and worsening renal function. He was initiated on warfarin \non ___.\n\n# Type 2 NSTEMI\n# CAD s/p 2 stents here at ___ is at ___ at ___. Per wife, ___ one\nyear ago was stable from prior. Troponin elevation likely demand\nin the setting of renal dysfunction. ___ with preserved EF and\nmild AS. Lasix and losartan were held at last discharge, and \nwere continued\nto be held given soft BPs. He appears euvolemic on exam.\n\n#Anemia\nLikely partially due to acute blood loss from perinephric \nhematoma.
