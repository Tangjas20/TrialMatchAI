ECHO from IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated right ventricle. At least mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of , the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased from moderate to mild, the severity of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension has decreased from severe to moderate, and the right ventricle appears less dilated with normal systolic function. Brief Hospital Course: Ms. is a female with hx of breast cancer on tamoxifen, dCHF, CKD, HTN, and poorly controlled IDDM who p/w emesisx1, hyperglycemia and found to be hyponatremic # Hyperglycemia (oorly controlled insulin-dependent DM type II). Patient's sugars improved while inpatient. A1c checked was 9.5 (up from 8.8). Etiology of hyperglycemia unclear (? brief viral infection). She was slightly hypoglycemic on one night given high ISS, but was stable once her home ISS was re-initiated. Continued home NPH insulin (20 QAM, 10 QPM) and ISS of Humalog 1 unit for 100-150, 1 units for 150-200, 2 units for 201-250, 4 units for 250-300, 6 units for 300-350, 8 units for 350-400, 10 units for >400 # N/V without abdominal pain: patient reported 1 episode of this. This resolved prior to hospitalization and etiology is unclear. She was stable while inpatient. # Hyponatremia: Probably was due to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of emesis and poor PO intake and likely glucosuria. Discharge sodium was 140. # Chronic confusion: her niece/caretaker reports this is ongoing, waxing/ waning, but gradually progressive and manifests primarily as poor recall of recent events and instructions. Has not had changes in her attention or orientation during recent illness as far as family is aware or on exam and was stable through hospitalization # Microcytic anemia: near baseline. Of note patient gets iron with medication package at home. # with possible exacerbation: Cxray on admission without pulmonary edema or vascular congestion. She was placed back on her home diuretics once electrolytes improved. # CKD: Cr & BUN at approximately her baseline # HTN: home BP regimen included clonidine 0.3 mg daily which we stopped. She was normotensive with just her lisinopril 10mg daily # AFib on apixiban: continued on apixiban # Hx of breast cancer: continued home tamoxifen TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Home clonidine was stopped given normotensive on lisinopril 10mg. Reassess in outpatient and consider restarting or placing on a calcium channel blocker. Needs close monitoring of to ensure not hypoglycemic. Currently appears to be doing well on home regimen while inpatient Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Lisinopril 10 mg PO DAILY 2.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Miss , You were admitted due to elevated sugars and abnormal electrolytes. These were all fixed. It was unclear what caused this and could have been due to a viral infection. You were stable in the hospital and improved and as such were discharged home. While you were here, we stopped your clonidine. If your blood pressure goes up, please talk to your doctor. It was a pleasure being part of your care. Your team. Followup Instructions:"
