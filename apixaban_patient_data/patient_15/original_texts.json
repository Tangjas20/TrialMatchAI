A1c checked was 9.5 \n(up from 8.8). Etiology of hyperglycemia unclear (? brief viral \ninfection). She was slightly hypoglycemic on one night given \nhigh ISS, but was stable once her home ISS was re-initiated.\nContinued home NPH insulin (20 QAM, 10 QPM) and ISS of Humalog 1 \nunit for ___ 100-150, 1 units for 150-200, 2 units for 201-250, 4 \nunits for 250-300, 6 units for 300-350, 8 units for 350-400, 10 \nunits for >400\n\n# N/V without abdominal pain: patient reported 1 episode of \nthis. This resolved prior to hospitalization and etiology is \nunclear. She was stable while inpatient.\n\n# Hyponatremia: Probably was due to hypovolemic hyponatremia in \nthe setting of emesis and poor PO intake and likely glucosuria. \nDischarge sodium was 140.\n\n# Chronic confusion: her niece/caretaker reports this is \nongoing, waxing/ waning, but gradually progressive and manifests \nprimarily as poor recall of recent events and instructions.

Of note patient gets iron \nwith medication package at home.\n\n# ___ with possible exacerbation: Cxray on admission without \npulmonary edema or vascular congestion. She was placed back on \nher home diuretics once electrolytes improved.\n\n# CKD: Cr & BUN at approximately her baseline\n\n# HTN: home BP regimen included clonidine 0.3 mg daily which we \nstopped.
